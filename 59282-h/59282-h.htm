<p><span class="smcap">Have</span> you ever wanted to be
in a number of places at the
same time? Then you know exactly
how Peter Rabbit felt in
the beautiful springtime. You
see, there was so much going on
everywhere all the time that
Peter felt sure he was missing
something, no matter how much
he saw and heard. In that he
was quite right.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>But you may be sure Peter did
his best not to miss any more than
he had to. He scampered lipperty-lipperty-lip
this way, lipperty-lipperty-lip
that way, and lipperty-lipperty-lip
the other way,
watching, listening, asking questions
and making a nuisance of
himself generally. For a while
there were so many new arrivals
in the Old Orchard and on the
Green Meadows, feathered friends
returning from the Sunny South
and in a great hurry to begin
housekeeping, and strangers passing
through on their way to the
Far North, that Peter hardly
gave the Green Forest a thought.</p>

<p>But one moonlight night he
happened to think of Paddy the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
Beaver and that he hadn&#8217;t seen
Paddy since before Paddy&#8217;s pond
froze over early in the winter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must run over and pay
him my respects,&#8221; thought Peter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly must. I wonder
if he is as glad as the rest of
us that Sweet Mistress Spring is
here.&#8221;</p>

<p>No sooner did he think of
this than Peter started, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
through the Green
Forest for the pond of Paddy
the Beaver. Now the nearest
way was past the great windfall
where Mrs. Bear made her home.
Peter hadn&#8217;t thought of this
when he started. He didn&#8217;t
think of it until he came in
sight of it. The instant he saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
that old windfall he stopped short.
He remembered Mrs. Bear and
that he had heard that she had
a secret. Instantly curiosity took
possession of him. He forgot all
about Paddy the Beaver.</p>

<p>For some time Peter sat perfectly
still, looking and listening.
There was no sign of Mrs. Bear.
Was she under that windfall in
her bedroom taking a nap, or
was she off somewhere? Peter
wished he knew. It was such
a lovely night that he had a
feeling Mrs. Bear was out somewhere.
A hop at a time, pausing
to look and listen between
hops, Peter drew nearer to the
great windfall. Still there was
no sign of Mrs. Bear.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>With his heart going pit-a-pat,
pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat, Peter drew
nearer and nearer to the great
windfall, and at last was close
to it on the side opposite to
Mrs. Bear&#8217;s entrance. Taking
care not to so much as rustle a dry
leaf on the ground, Peter stole
around the end of the great windfall
until he could see the entrance
Mrs. Bear always used.
No one was in sight. Peter drew
a long breath and hopped a
little nearer. He felt very
brave and bold, but you may be
sure that at the same time he
was ready to jump and run, as
only he can at the least hint of
danger.</p>

<p>For a long time Peter sat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
and stared at that entrance and
wished he dared just poke his
head inside. If Mrs. Bear really
had a secret, it was somewhere
inside there. Anyway, that is
what old Granny Fox had said.
He had almost worked his courage
up to the point of taking
just one hurried little peek in
that entrance when his long ears
caught a faint rustling sound
under the great windfall.</p>

<p>Peter scurried off to a safe
distance, then turned and stared
at that entrance. He half expected
to see Mrs. Bear&#8217;s great
head come poking out and he
was ready to take to his heels.
Instead a very small head and then
another close beside it appeared.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Peter was so surprised he nearly
fell over backward. Then in a
flash it came to him that he knew
Mrs. Bear&#8217;s secret. It was out
at last. Yes, sir, it was out at
last. Mrs. Bear had a family!
Mrs. Bear and Buster Bear had
twins!</p>

<small>PETER SCARES THE TWINS</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">For timid folk no joy is quite</div>
<div class="verse">Like giving other folks a fright.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> isn&#8217;t often that Peter Rabbit
has a chance to scare any
one. You know he is such a
timid fellow himself that he is
the one who usually gets the
fright. So when he does happen
to scare some one it always
amuses him. Somehow he always
has more respect for himself.</p>

<p>When on that moonlight night
he discovered Mrs. Bear&#8217;s secret,
he had the most mixed feelings
he ever had known. First came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
surprise, as he saw those two
little heads poked out of Mrs.
Bear&#8217;s entrance. He was sitting
up very straight and the surprise
was so great that he all but
tumbled over backwards. You
see, there was no mistaking those
two little heads for any but
those of baby Bears! He knew
that those were two Bear cubs,
Mrs. Bear&#8217;s babies, the secret she
had kept hidden so long under
the great windfall.</p>

<p>And his surprise at seeing
those two little heads was only
a little greater than his surprise
at the smallness of them. So
for perhaps two minutes Peter
sat motionless, quite overcome
with surprise, as he stared at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
those two funny little heads
poked out from the entrance
under the great windfall. Then
all in a flash he understood the
cause of Mrs. Bear&#8217;s short temper
and the reason she drove everybody
away from there, and he
felt a sudden panic of fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is no place for me,&#8221;
thought Peter, &#8220;and the sooner I
get away from here the better.&#8221;
He looked hastily all about. There
was no sign of Mrs. Bear. Right
then and there curiosity returned
in full force.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish those youngsters would
come out where I can look at
them and just see how big they
are,&#8221; thought Peter. &#8220;It seems
safe enough here now, and perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
if I wait a few minutes
they will come out.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Peter waited. Sure enough,
in a few minutes the two little
cubs did come out. Plainly it
was their first glimpse of the
Green Forest, and Peter almost
laughed right out at the look of
wonder on their faces as they
stared all about in the moonlight.
But not even his first surprise
was greater than Peter&#8217;s surprise
now as he saw how small they
were.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; he exclaimed to himself,
&#8220;why-ee, they are no bigger
than I! I didn&#8217;t suppose any
one so big as great big Mrs. Bear
could have such small children.
I wonder how old they are. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
wonder how big they were when
they were born. I wonder if
they will grow fast. I wonder
if they will go about with Mrs.
Bear. I suppose Buster Bear is
their father, and I wonder if he
ever comes to see them. They
look to me rather wobbly on
their legs. I wonder if Mrs.
Bear told them they could come
out.&#8221;</p>

<p>And then the imp of mischief
whispered to Peter. &#8220;I wonder
if I can scare them,&#8221; thought
Peter. &#8220;It would be great fun
to scare a Bear, even if it is nothing
but a cub, and to scare
two at once would be greater
fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter suddenly thumped the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
ground very hard with his hind
feet. It was so still there in
the Green Forest that that thump
sounded very loud. The two
little cubs gave a startled look
towards Peter. As he sat up
straight in the moonlight, he
looked very big. That is, he did
to those two little cubs who
never had seen him before.</p>

<p>With funny little whimpers of
fright they turned and fairly
tumbled over each other as they
scurried back through the entrance
under the great windfall. Peter
laughed and laughed until his
sides ached. He, Peter Rabbit,
actually had frightened two Bears
and made them run. Now he would
have something to boast about.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> two frightened little cubs
ran, whimpering and tumbling
over each other, for the safety
of the bedroom under the great
windfall, Peter Rabbit thumped
twice more just by way of adding
to their fright. It was most unkind
of Peter. Of course. He should
have been ashamed of trying to
frighten babies, and those two
cubs were babies and nothing more.
They were baby Bears.</p>

<p>But Peter had so often felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
little cold chills of fear chasing
each other up and down his backbone
in the presence of Buster
Bear and Mrs. Bear that it
tickled him to be able to scare
any Bears, big or little. Truth
to tell, it gave him a feeling as
if somehow he was getting even
with Buster and Mrs. Bear. Of
course he wasn&#8217;t. Certainly not.
But he had that feeling, and he
didn&#8217;t once stop to think how
cowardly it was to frighten babies,
even though they were Bear
babies.</p>

<p>After the two cubs had disappeared,
he could hear them
scrambling along under the great
windfall as they hurried for the
darkest corner of that dark bedroom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
where Mother Bear had left
them when she went out to look
for something to eat. All the way
there they whimpered just as if
they thought some dreadful enemy
was after them. Peter laughed
until his sides ached and the tears
came to his eyes.</p>

<p>An angry growl right behind
him put a sudden end to Peter&#8217;s
laughter and glee. It was his turn
to run headlong and to whimper
as he ran. My, what jumps he
made! It seemed as if his feet
barely touched the ground before
he was in the air again. If those
little cubs had been scared, Peter
was twice as scared. They had
run without knowing what they
ran from. But Peter knew what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
he was running from. He was
running from an angry mother,
and that mother was a Bear.
It was enough to make anybody
run.</p>

<p>Peter had been so intent on
frightening those little cubs and
then laughing at them that he had
not heard Mother Bear until she had
given that angry growl right behind
him. Then he hadn&#8217;t stopped to
explain. Peter believes in running
first and explaining later. But at
the rate he was going now, there
wouldn&#8217;t be any explaining, because
by the time he stopped Mother
Bear wouldn&#8217;t be near enough to
hear a word he said.</p>

<p>The fact is Mother Bear didn&#8217;t
follow Peter. She simply growled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
once or twice in her deepest, most
grumbly-rumbly voice just to add
a little speed to Peter&#8217;s long legs,
if that were possible. Then as
she watched Peter run headlong
she grinned. Just as Peter had
laughed at the fright of the little
cubs, Mother Bear grinned at
Peter&#8217;s fright.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope that will teach him a
lesson,&#8221; muttered Mrs. Bear, way
down in her throat. &#8220;I don&#8217;t
want that long-eared bunch of
curiosity hanging around here.
He got a glimpse of those youngsters
of mine, and now my secret
will be out. Well, I suppose it
would have had to be out soon.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Bear turned into the entrance
to her bedroom under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
windfall, while Peter Rabbit kept
on, lipperty-lipperty-lip, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
through the Green
Forest towards the Green Meadows
and the dear Old Briar-patch.
He was eager to get there and
tell the news of Mrs. Bear&#8217;s long-kept
secret.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> in all the Green Forest could
two livelier or more mischievous
little folks be found than Boxer and
Woof-Woof. Boxer was just a wee
bit bigger than his sister, but he
was no smarter, nor was he the
least bit quicker. For more than
three months they had lived under
the great windfall in the Green
Forest without even once poking
their funny little noses outside.
You see, when they were born they
were very small and helpless.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>And the first time they had
poked their heads out, Peter Rabbit
had given them a terrible scare
by thumping the ground with his
hind feet. Safely back in their bedroom
they snuggled together.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who do you suppose that terrible
fellow was?&#8221; whispered
Woof-Woof. How that would
have pleased Peter could he have
heard it!</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea,&#8221; replied
Boxer. &#8220;I guess we are
lucky to be safely back here. Did
you notice how his ears stood up?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must ask Mother Bear
about him,&#8221; said Woof-Woof.
&#8220;He was only about our size, and
perhaps he isn&#8217;t so terrible after
all. Here she comes now.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not say anything about
it,&#8221; whispered Boxer hurriedly.
&#8220;You know she told us not to go
outside. We may see him again
sometime and then we can ask
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>So when Mrs. Bear arrived she
found Boxer and Woof-Woof curled
up with their arms around each
other and looking as innocent as it
was possible for baby Bears to
look. Mother Bear grinned. She
knew just what had happened out
there, for she had seen it all. You
remember that she had frightened
Peter Rabbit even more than he
had frightened the cubs. But she
wisely decided that she would say
nothing about it then.</p>

<p>&#8220;These cubs have had their first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
lesson in life,&#8221; thought she, as she
watched them trying so hard to
appear to be asleep. &#8220;They disobeyed
and as a result they got a
great fright. I won&#8217;t tell them
that Peter Rabbit is one of the
most harmless fellows in all the
Great World. They will remember
this fright longer if I don&#8217;t.
These scamps are growing like
weeds. They went outside tonight
while I was away, and that
means that it is time to take them
out and show them something of
the Great World. If I don&#8217;t,
they will try it again while I am
away, and something might happen
to them. They are still so small
that if Old Man Coyote should
happen to find one of them alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I am afraid the sly old sinner
would make an end of that cub.&#8221;</p>

<p>She poked the two cubs.
&#8220;You&#8217;re not asleep,&#8221; said she.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t think you can fool your
mother. To-morrow morning you
can go outside and play a little
while, providing you will promise
not to go more than one jump
away from the entrance to this
home of ours. There are great
dangers in the Green Forest for
little Bears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Boxer and Woof-Woof
promised, and so for several mornings
they played just outside the
entrance while their mother pretended
to take a nap. It was then
that Chatterer the Red Squirrel and
Sammy Jay and Blacky the Crow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
had great fun frightening those
twin cubs. And they didn&#8217;t know,
nor did the twins, that all the time
Mother Bear knew just what was
going on and was keeping quiet
so that the twins might learn for
themselves.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Not</span> in all the Green Forest is
there a wiser or better mother
than Mrs. Bear. No one knows
better than she the dangers of
the Great World, or the importance
of learning early in life all
those things which a Bear who
would live to a good old age
should know. So after allowing
the twins, Boxer and Woof-Woof,
to play around the entrance to
their home under the great windfall
for a few days, she took<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
them for their first walk in the
Green Forest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said she, as she prepared
to lead the way, &#8220;you are
to do just as I do. You are to
follow right at my heels, and the
one who turns aside for anything
without my permission will be
spanked. Do you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Boxer and
Woof-Woof meekly.</p>

<p>My, my, my, how excited they
were as Mother Bear led the
way out from under the old
windfall! This was to be a great,
a wonderful adventure. They
tingled all over. They were
actually going out to see something
of the Great World.</p>

<p>The first thing Mother Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
did was to sit up and carefully
test the wind with her nose.
Boxer sat up and did exactly the
same thing. Woof-Woof sat up
and did exactly the same thing.
The Merry Little Breezes tickled
their noses with many scents.
Mother Bear knew what each one
was, but of course the twins
didn&#8217;t know any of them. All
they knew was that they smelled
good.</p>

<p>Mother Bear cocked her ears forward
and listened. Boxer cocked
his ears forward and listened.
Woof-Woof cocked her ears forward
and listened. Mother Bear looked
this way and looked that way.
Boxer looked this way and looked
that way. So did Woof-Woof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>&#8220;These are the things you must
always do whenever you start out in
the Great World,&#8221; explained Mother
Bear in her deep, grumbly-rumbly
voice. &#8220;You must learn to know
the meaning of every scent that
reaches your nose, of every sound
that reaches your ears, of everything
you see, for only by such knowledge
can you keep out of danger. But
you must never trust your ears or
your eyes only. Your nose is more
to be trusted than either ears or eyes
or both ears and eyes. But always
use all three.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Boxer and
Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>Then Mother Bear started off
among the great trees, shuffling
along and swinging her head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
from side to side. Right at her
heels shuffled Boxer, swinging his
head from side to side, and right
at his heels shuffled Woof-Woof,
swinging her head from side to
side. Whatever Mother Bear did
the twins did. They did it because
Mother Bear did it. They
were keeping their promise. And
little as they were, they felt
very big and important, for now
at last they were out in the
Great World.</p>

<p>Chatterer the Red Squirrel saw
them start out, and he chuckled
as he watched those two funny
little cubs do exactly as Mother
Bear did. He followed along in
the tree tops, jumping from tree
to tree, but taking the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
care to make no noise. He was
fairly aching for a chance to
scare those cubs. But as long
as Mother Bear was with them,
he didn&#8217;t dare to try.</p>

<p>Mother Bear stopped and
sniffed at an old log. Then she
went on. Boxer stopped and
solemnly sniffed at that old log.
Then he went on. Woof-Woof
stopped and sniffed at that old
log. Then she went on. And
so at last they came to a place
where the earth was soft and
where grew certain roots of
which Mrs. Bear is very fond.</p>

<small>THE TWINS CLIMB A TREE</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Those climb the highest who have dared</div>
<div class="verse">To keep on climbing when most scared.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Mother Bear reached
the place where grew the roots
of which she was so fond, she
led the twins, Boxer and Woof-Woof,
over to a big tree, stood
up and dug her great claws into
the bark above her head. Of course
Boxer did the same thing. Mother
Bear gave him a push. Boxer was
so surprised that without realizing
what he was doing he pulled himself
up a little higher, clinging to the
tree with the claws of all four feet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
and hugging the trunk with arms
and legs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go right on up,&#8221; said Mother
Bear in her deep, grumbly-rumbly
voice. &#8220;Go right on up until
you reach those branches up there.
There is nothing to fear. Those
claws were given you for climbing,
and it is time for you to learn how
to use them. When you get up
to those branches, you stay up
there until I tell you to come
down. If you don&#8217;t, you will
be spanked. Now up with you!
Let me see you climb.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boxer scrambled a little higher.
Mother Bear turned and started
Woof-Woof up after Boxer. It
was a strange experience for the
twins. Never before had they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
been above the ground, and it
frightened them. They scrambled
a little way then looked down
and whimpered. Then they looked
up at the branches above them.
To Boxer and Woof-Woof those
branches seemed a terrible distance
up. They seemed way, way up
in the sky. Really they were
not very high up at all. But
you remember the twins were
very little, and this was their first
climb.</p>

<p>So they stopped and whimpered
and looked down longingly at
the ground. But right under
them stood Mother Bear, and
there was a look in her eyes
that told them she intended to
be obeyed. Having her standing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
right below them gave them
courage. So Boxer scrambled a
little higher. Then Woof-Woof,
who simply couldn&#8217;t allow her
brother to do anything she didn&#8217;t
do, scrambled a little higher.
Boxer started again. Woof-Woof
followed. And so at last they
reached the branches. Then and
not until then Mother Bear left
the foot of the tree and shuffled
off to dig for roots.</p>

<p>The instant they got hold of
those branches the twins felt safe.
They forgot their fears. Quite
unexpectedly they felt very much
at home. And of course they
felt very big and bold. For a
while they were content to sit
and look down at the wonderful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
Great World. It seemed to them
that from way up there they must
be looking at nearly all of the
Great World. Of course, they
really were looking at only a
very small part of the Green
Forest. But it was very, very
wonderful to the twins, and they
looked and looked and for a
long time they didn&#8217;t say a
word.</p>

<p>By and by they noticed Mother
Bear digging roots some distance
away. &#8220;Isn&#8217;t it funny that
Mother Bear has grown so much
smaller?&#8221; ventured Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>Boxer looked puzzled. Mother
Bear certainly did look smaller.
Even as he watched she moved
farther away, and the farther she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
went the smaller she seemed to
be. Boxer held on with one
hand and scratched his head
with the other. For the first
time in his life he was doing some
real thinking. &#8220;I don&#8217;t believe
she can be any smaller,&#8221; said
he. &#8220;It must be she looks
smaller because she is so far
away. That old log down there
looks smaller than it did when
we stopped and sniffed at it.
Some of those young trees that
looked tall when we passed under
them don&#8217;t look tall at all
now. I guess the way a thing
looks depends on how near it
is!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of course Boxer was quite
right in this. He was already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
beginning to learn, beginning to
use those lively wits which Old
Mother Nature had put in that
funny little head of his.</p>

<small>A SCARE THAT DIDN&#8217;T WORK</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Take my advice and pray beware</div>
<div class="verse">Of how you try to scare a Bear.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Chatterer</span> the Red Squirrel
was indignant. He was very
indignant. In fact Chatterer
was angry. You know he is
short-tempered and it doesn&#8217;t
take a great deal to make him
lose his temper. He had watched
Mrs. Bear and the twins start
out from the great windfall and
had silently followed, keeping in
the tree tops as much as possible,
and taking the greatest care not
to let Mrs. Bear or the twins
know that he was about.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>Inside he had chuckled to see
the twins do exactly what Mother
Bear did. When she sat up and
they sat up beside her, they
looked so funny that he had
hard work to keep from laughing
right out. He had seen many
funny things in the Green Forest,
but nothing quite so funny as
those two little Bears, hardly
bigger than Peter Rabbit, gravely
doing just exactly what their
mother did.</p>

<p>So Chatterer followed, all the
time hoping for a chance to give
those twins a scare. But he
didn&#8217;t want to try it while
Mother Bear was around. So he
waited, hoping that she would
leave them alone for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
minutes. Finally Mother Bear
set the twins to climbing a tree.
It was then that Chatterer
became so very indignant. His
sharp eyes snapped as he watched
the twins scramble up that tree.
He hoped they would fall. Yes,
sir, Chatterer really hoped those
twin cubs would fall.</p>

<p>You see, the trouble was that
Chatterer didn&#8217;t like the idea of
those little Bears learning to
climb trees. He felt that the
trees belonged to the Squirrel
family. It was bad enough to
have Bobby Coon and Unc&#8217; Billy
Possum climbing them. Now to
have two lively little Bears
learning to climb was too much.
It was altogether too much.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>&#8220;They haven&#8217;t any business in
trees,&#8221; sputtered Chatterer to
himself, taking care not to be
heard. &#8220;They haven&#8217;t any business
in trees. They belong on
the ground, not in trees. I
won&#8217;t have them in the trees! I
won&#8217;t! I won&#8217;t!&#8221;</p>

<p>Now of course Chatterer knew,
right down in his heart, that
those cubs had just as much
right in the trees as had he.</p>

<p>The real truth of the matter
was that so long as those little
cubs remained on the ground,
Chatterer feared them not at all.
He could be as saucy and impudent
to them as he pleased. He
could tease them and try to scare
them and feel quite safe about it,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
so long as their mother wasn&#8217;t
about. But if those cubs were
going to learn to climb, and he
had a feeling that they would
make very good climbers, matters
might be altogether different.</p>

<p>Chatterer watched the twins
and he watched Mother Bear.
At last the latter disappeared
from sight. Unseen by the twins,
Chatterer leaped across to the
very tree in which they were
sitting, but above them. &#8220;I&#8217;ll
give them such a scare that they
will either fall down or will
scramble down and never&#8217;ll want
to climb another tree,&#8221; muttered
Chatterer.</p>

<p>Silently he crept up behind
them; then he opened his mouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and yelled at them. &#8220;Get down
out of this tree!&#8221; he yelled.
&#8220;Get down out of this tree!&#8221;</p>

<p>He was so close to those little
Bears that his voice seemed to be
in their very ears. They recognized
it as a voice which had
scared them two or three times
when they had first come out of
the great windfall to play. It
was so close and so unexpected
that it startled them so that they
almost let go their hold. Then
Boxer turned and for the first
time had a good view of Chatterer.
He was looking at a very angry
Red Squirrel. But instead of
being afraid and starting to
scramble down from that tree, as
Chatterer had expected him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
do, Boxer suddenly started straight
for him, and it was plain to see
that Boxer was an angry small
Bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> best laid plans, even those

sometimes go wrong. Chatterer&#8217;s
plan had gone wrong, just about as

from that tree, had been made angry

people who try to scare babies,
Chatterer is not at all brave.
Most of his bravery is in his tongue.
For just an instant he was too surprised
to move. Even his tongue
was still. Then he turned and
ran up that tree as fast as he could.</p>

<p>The twins came scrambling after,
and they came surprisingly fast.
You see, there were plenty of
branches to hold on to, so they had
no fear of falling. Chatterer was
so scared that he didn&#8217;t use those
usually quick wits of his, and he
ran up past the only branch of
that tree that reached out near
enough to another tree for him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
jump across. When he thought of
it, it was too late. Yes, sir, it was
too late. Boxer was already standing
on that very branch.</p>

<p>Chatterer felt then that he was
trapped. He couldn&#8217;t jump across
to another tree. He didn&#8217;t dare
try to get down past those twins.
He wouldn&#8217;t think of jumping
down to the ground, unless he was
actually obliged to, for it was a
dreadful jump. All he could do
was to climb higher and hope those
twins would be afraid to follow him.</p>

<p>But by this time Boxer and
Woof-Woof were enjoying the
chase. They were enjoying the
fun of climbing, and they were
enjoying the discovery that they
were no longer afraid of this saucy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
red-coated scamp, but that he was
afraid of them.</p>

<p>&#8220;See him run!&#8221; cried Boxer.
&#8220;Come on, Woof-Woof, let&#8217;s catch
him! He is so small and quick
that he can get about faster than
we can, but we are two and he is
only one. Between us we ought
to be able to catch him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Woof-Woof was quite willing,
and they climbed on up after
Chatterer. Chatterer&#8217;s tongue was
still now. He made no sound.
He no longer called names. He
no longer made faces. He no
longer looked saucy or impudent.
He looked exactly what he was, a
badly scared Red Squirrel. He
was sorry now that he had lost his
temper and tried to scare those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
twins. He was very, very sorry.
But it was too late. Being sorry
didn&#8217;t help him any now.</p>

<p>He was in a bad scrape, was
Chatterer, and he knew it. Either
of those twin Bears was much bigger
than he, although they were
little more than babies. They
had found him out and had already
discovered that they had nothing
to fear from him and that he was
afraid of them. It was plain to see
that they were having a good time.
They were enjoying the chase.
Chatterer looked down at their
sharp little claws and more than
ever he was sorry he had not let
them alone.</p>

<p>By this time Chatterer was
clinging to the very top of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
tree. If those twins came up
there, he would have to make the
terrible jump to the ground. He
shivered as he looked down.
Would those surprising twins, or
one of them, be able to get up
near enough to reach him?</p>

<small>THE TWINS HAVE TO GO HOME</small></h2></div>

<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Boxer</span> and Woof-Woof were
having the best time of their
short lives. Climbing was great
fun. Although this was the first
time they had climbed a tree,
they already felt quite at home
up there where the branches grew.
It was fun just to climb from
branch to branch. It was still
greater fun to chase that red-coated
little rascal who had tried to
scare them out of that tree. You
see, this was the first time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
twins had found any one afraid
of them, and it made them feel
quite important. It made them
feel big. They felt twice as big
as when they had whimperingly
started to climb that tree. So
the twins were having a wonderful
time.</p>

<p>But Chatterer the Red Squirrel
was having anything but a wonderful
time. He was wishing with
all his might that he had kept
his saucy tongue still; that he
had not jumped over into that
tree to try to scare those cubs;
that he had not followed them
in the first place; that they
would become dizzy and afraid.
He even wished that they would
fall. The fact is, Chatterer was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
so badly frightened that he was
capable of wishing almost anything
dreadful if it would only
give him a chance to escape.</p>

<p>Now if Chatterer had not been
so badly frightened, he would
have seen that Boxer, the twin
who was in the lead, was already
hesitating. He had reached a
point where the branches were so
small that they bent dangerously
when he stepped on them. He
had climbed as high as it was
safe for him to climb, and he
knew it. But having set out to
catch that red mischief-maker, he
couldn&#8217;t bear to give up. That
is, he felt that if he did give up,
Chatterer would boast that he
had been too smart for the cubs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
and would make fun of them.
And this is just what Chatterer
would have done.</p>

<p>So while Chatterer was wishing
with all his might that something
would happen to those twins,
the twins were wishing for some
good excuse for stopping the
chase without losing the respect
they knew Chatterer now had
for them.</p>

<p>Just then a deep, grumbly-rumbly
voice came up to them
from the foot of the tree. &#8220;Come
down at once,&#8221; said the voice. It
was the voice of Mother Bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Woof-Woof
meekly, beginning to climb down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to catch this fellow
who tried to scare us,&#8221; whined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Boxer, pretending that he didn&#8217;t
want to come down.</p>

<p>&#8220;You heard what I said,&#8221; replied
Mother Bear, and her voice
was more grumbly-rumbly than
before. &#8220;It is time to go home.
Come down this instant.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Boxer, and
this time he said it quite as
meekly as had his sister Woof-Woof.
There was something in
the sound of Mother Bear&#8217;s voice
that warned Boxer that it would
be unwise to disobey.</p>

<p>So, with a warning to Chatterer
that next time he would not get
off so easily, Boxer began to climb
down after Woof-Woof. When
the cubs reached the lowest
branches and had only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
straight trunk to which to cling,
they were once more afraid, and
all the way down they whimpered.
Somehow it was harder to climb
down than up. It often is. But
at last they were on the ground.
Mother Bear&#8217;s eyes twinkled with
pride, but she took care that the
cubs should not see this.</p>

<p>&#8220;Obedience,&#8221; said she, &#8220;is the
first great lesson in life. It saved
you a spanking this time.&#8221; Then
she led the way home.</p>

<p>And as Boxer and Woof-Woof
followed, doing exactly as she
did, they heard the jeering voice
of Chatterer the Red Squirrel.</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t catch me! Couldn&#8217;t
catch me!&#8221; jeered Chatterer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">This</span> is sad but true. It is so
everywhere in the Great World,
and the Great World would be a
much better place in which to live
if it were not so. It is the desire
to get even that makes much of the
trouble and the hard feeling and
the unhappiness everywhere. But
there are times when getting even
certainly does give a lot of satisfaction.
It was so with the twins,
Boxer and Woof-Woof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>You remember that the very
first time they ventured out from
under the great windfall Peter
Rabbit had given them a great
fright by thumping the ground
with his hind-feet as only Peter
can thump. The twins were so
small then and they knew so
little of the Great World, in fact
nothing at all, that Peter had
seemed to them a terrible fellow.
They never had forgotten him.
Whenever they were outside the
great windfall, they watched for
him, ready to run at sight of him.</p>

<p>But it was a long time before
they saw Peter again, and when
they did they had grown so that
they were considerably bigger than
he. Besides, they had been out on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
several trips into the Great World
with Mother Bear and had learned
many things, for little Bears learn
very fast and have the best of
memories. At last they saw Peter
again. It happened this way:</p>

<p>Peter had stayed away from the
Green Forest as long as he could.
Then curiosity to see what was
going on over there had been too
much for him, and he had started
over to visit Paddy the Beaver.
He took great care to keep away
from the great windfall where
Mother Bear and the twins lived.
As curious as he was about those
twins, and much as he wanted to
see them again, he was too much
afraid of Mrs. Bear and her short
temper to take any chances. But<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
he felt that it would be quite safe
to visit Paddy the Beaver, for
Paddy&#8217;s pond was some distance
from the great windfall.</p>

<p>Now Peter didn&#8217;t know that
Mother Bear was in the habit of
taking the twins with her wherever
she went. It just happened
that this very day she had chosen
to go over near the pond of Paddy
the Beaver. The twins had played
until they were tired and then had
curled up for a nap in a sunny
spot while their mother went fishing
in the Laughing Brook.</p>

<p>When Peter arrived in sight of
Paddy&#8217;s pond Mother Bear was
hidden behind some brush a little
way up the Laughing Brook, and
was sitting quietly waiting for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
fish to come within reach. For
once Peter was careless. He was
so intent looking for Paddy the
Beaver that he didn&#8217;t use his eyes
and ears for other things, as he
should have. So he passed within
a few feet of the twins without
seeing them. Just beyond he sat
up to look over the pond for Paddy.</p>

<p>Now the twins slept each with
an ear open, as the saying is, and
they heard Peter pass. Open flew
their eyes, and they saw at once
that it was the terrible fellow who
had so frightened them once. But
somehow he no longer looked terrible.
He was smaller than they
had thought. In fact, they were
now considerably bigger than he.
You see, they had been growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
very fast. Boxer&#8217;s eyes twinkled.
Perhaps this fellow was like Chatterer
the Red Squirrel, bold and terrible
only to those who feared him.
He nudged Woof-Woof. Very
softly they got to their feet and
stole up behind Peter.</p>

<p>A twig snapped under Boxer&#8217;s
feet. Peter turned. His eyes
seemed to pop right out of his
head. With a squeal of fright,
Peter jumped and started, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
for the nearest pile of
brush, and after him raced the
twins. They knew now that this
terrible fellow was more afraid of
them than ever they had been of him,
and they meant to get even for the
fright he had given them when they
were so little. It was great fun.</p>

<small>PETER IS IN A TIGHT PLACE</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">It is no time to think of fright.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Boxer</span> and Woof-Woof were
having no end of fun. Having
chased Peter Rabbit under a pile
of brush, they were now trying
to catch him. It was even more
fun than it had been to try to
catch Chatterer the Red Squirrel
in the top of a tree.</p>

<p>But for Peter Rabbit it was
no fun at all. The truth is,
Peter was in a tight place and
he knew it. Never had he been
more badly frightened. It would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
have been bad enough had there
been only one little Bear. Two
little Bears made it more than
twice as bad.</p>

<p>In the first place they were
very lively, were those two little
Bears. Peter hadn&#8217;t known that
little Bears could be so lively.
You see, these were the first he
ever had seen. The way in
which they ran around that pile
of brush showed how very quick
on their feet they were. Peter
didn&#8217;t doubt that he could outrun
them if he could get a fair
start; the trouble was to get
that fair start. He wished now
that he had trusted to his long
legs instead of seeking shelter
under that pile of brush. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
had done that in the suddenness
of his fright, when the little
Bears had surprised him. It is
Peter&#8217;s nature to seek a hiding-place
in time of danger, and usually
this is the wisest thing for him to do.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see him!&#8221; cried Boxer, poking
his funny little head under the
brush on one side. &#8220;I&#8217;ll crawl
under and drive him out to you,
Woof-Woof!&#8221;</p>

<p>On the other side of the brush
pile Woof-Woof danced up and
down excitedly. &#8220;I&#8217;ll get him!
I&#8217;ll get him!&#8221; she cried. &#8220;Drive
him out, Boxer! Drive him out!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch!&#8221; cried Boxer, as a sharp
stick scratched his face. &#8220;He&#8217;s
crawling towards the end, Woof-Woof!
Watch out!&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>&#8220;Which end?&#8221; cried Woof-Woof,
running from one end to
the other and back again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ouch! Wow! I&#8217;m stuck!&#8221;
came the voice of Boxer. A
minute later he backed out. &#8220;No
use; I can&#8217;t get under there,&#8221; he
panted. &#8220;I&#8217;ll jump on top, and see
if I can&#8217;t scare him out that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Boxer climbed up on the
pile of brush and jumped up and
down, while Woof-Woof ran back
and forth around the edge of the
pile of brush, stopping to peep
under at every opening.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see him! I see him, Boxer!&#8221;
she cried, and began to wriggle in
under the brush as Boxer had done.</p>

<p>But she didn&#8217;t go far. She
soon found that Peter could get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
through places where she couldn&#8217;t.
Besides, it seemed as if sharp
sticks were reaching for her from
every direction. Twice she
squealed as she scratched her
face on them. &#8220;How do you
like it,&#8221; called Boxer, grinning
at the sound of those squeals.</p>

<p>Woof-Woof backed out and
brushed bits of bark from her
coat, for she was much neater
than her brother. &#8220;I tell you
what,&#8221; said she, &#8220;let&#8217;s pull this
pile of brush all apart. Then
we&#8217;ll get him.&#8221;</p>

<p>So the twins set to work, one
on one side and one on the other,
to pull that pile of brush apart.
Yes, Peter Rabbit certainly was
in a tight place.</p>

<small>PETER TAKES A CHANCE</small></h2></div>

<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Those</span> twin cubs were very
much like some boys and girls.
They were like them in that they
were wholly thoughtless. They
were having a splendid time as
they tried to catch Peter Rabbit.
They hadn&#8217;t had so much fun for
days. Not once did it pop into
their funny little heads that Peter
was suffering because of their fun.
No, sir, they didn&#8217;t once think of
that.</p>

<p>But Peter was suffering. Peter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
was suffering from fright, and that
kind of suffering often is worse
than suffering from pain. He was
sure that those cubs meant to kill
him and eat him. As a matter of
fact, such an idea hadn&#8217;t entered
the heads of the twins. You see,
they were still too young to eat
meat. All they were thinking of
was the fun of catching Peter and
getting even with him for the scare
he had once given them.</p>

<p>Peter didn&#8217;t know this. Many
people had tried to catch him, and
every one of them had wanted him
for a dinner. So Peter was sure
that this was why Boxer and Woof-Woof
were trying so hard to catch
him. As he dodged about under
that pile of brush, his heart was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
his mouth most of the time. At
least, that is the way it seemed to
him. But this was nothing to the
way he felt when those cubs began
to pull apart that pile of brush.
Then for a minute despair took
possession of Peter.</p>

<p>But it was only for a minute.
Peter had been in many tight
places before, and he had learned
that giving up to despair is no way
to get out of tight places.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I stay here, they will get
me,&#8221; thought Peter. &#8220;If I take a
chance and run they may get me,
in which case I will be no worse
off. But they may not get me; so I
think I&#8217;ll take the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>He listened to those excited
little cubs working with might and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
main to pull that pile of brush
apart. One was on one side and
one was on the other. He might
get out at either end between them
and get a start before they saw him.
He started to creep towards one
end, but snapped a dead twig, and
the quick ears of Boxer heard it.
&#8220;He&#8217;s coming out!&#8221; squealed
Boxer, and ran around to that end.</p>

<p>Peter crept back to the middle.
In a minute or so Boxer was back,
pulling apart that brush. Then
an old saying of his mother&#8217;s
popped into Peter&#8217;s head. He had
heard her say it many times when
he was little and first venturing out
into the Great World.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_072fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Boxer climbed up on the pile of brush and

<p>&#8220;When you must take a chance,
always do the thing no one expects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
you to do,&#8221; was what his mother
had said over and over again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those cubs expect me to run
out at one end or the other,&#8221;
thought Peter. &#8220;They don&#8217;t expect
me to run out where either is
at work. To do that will take
them by surprise. It is my best
chance. Yes, sir, it is my best
chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>Peter crept toward the edge
where Boxer was at work tearing
that brush apart. Once more his
heart seemed to be in his mouth,
and it was going pit-a-pat, pit-a-pat.
Watching his chance, he
darted out under Boxer&#8217;s very
nose.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Peter darted out under
the very nose of Boxer, the little
Bear was so surprised that for a
couple of seconds he didn&#8217;t do a
thing. This was what Peter had
counted on. It gave him a fair
start. Then with a squeal Boxer
started after him.</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s out! He&#8217;s out! Come
on, Woof-Woof! We&#8217;ll catch him
now!&#8221; cried Boxer, and he was so
excited that he stumbled over his
own feet as he started after Peter.</p>

<p>When Peter came out from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
under that pile of brush, he
turned to the left and started
around the end of it, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
as fast as he could
go. Again Peter was doing the
unexpected. He knew that Woof-Woof
was on the other side of
that pile of brush, and he knew
that she knew that he knew she
was there. Of course, she
wouldn&#8217;t expect him to run
around where she was. That
would be the last thing in the
world she would expect.</p>

<p>So this is just what Peter did
do. Around the end of that pile
of brush, lipperty-lipperty-lip,
raced Peter, with Boxer at his
heels. Just as expected he met
Woof-Woof running as fast as she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
could. Peter dodged as only
Peter can. Woof-Woof was running
so fast she couldn&#8217;t stop
instantly. Boxer was running so
fast he couldn&#8217;t stop.</p>

<p>Perhaps you can guess what
happened. Those two little
Bears ran into each other so hard
that both were knocked over!
Yes, sir, that is just what happened.
Then both those little
Bears lost their little tempers.
They forgot all about Peter
Rabbit. Each blamed the other.
They scrambled to their feet.
Quick as a flash Boxer reached
out and boxed his sister side of
the head. &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you look
where you are going?&#8221; he
snapped.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>Woof-Woof was quite as quick
as Boxer. Slap went one of her
paws against the side of Boxer&#8217;s
face. &#8220;Do some looking out
yourself!&#8221; she sputtered.</p>

<p>They stood up and danced
around each other, cuffing and
slapping and saying unkind things.
They glared at each other with
little eyes red with anger. Boxer
suddenly threw his arms around
Woof-Woof and upset her. Then
they rolled over and over on the
ground, striking, scratching, and
trying to bite. First one would
be on top, then the other. Over
and over they tumbled, so fast
that had you been there you
would have seen such a mix-up
of little Bears that you wouldn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
have been able to tell one from
the other.</p>

<p>It was dreadful for those twins
to fight. But they had lost their
tempers and there they were.
You would never have guessed
that they were brother and sister.
After a while they were so out
of breath that they had to stop.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are we fighting for?&#8221;
asked Boxer, looking a little
shame-faced as he rubbed one ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; confessed Woof-Woof,
rubbing her nose.</p>

<p>&#8220;I-I-guess I lost my temper
because you ran into me,&#8221; said
Boxer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t. You ran into me,&#8221;
declared Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>&#8220;No such thing!&#8221; growled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Boxer, his eyes beginning to grow
red again. &#8220;You ran into me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Woof-Woofs little eyes began
to snap, and I am afraid that
there would have been another
dreadful scene had not the memory
of Peter Rabbit popped into
Boxer&#8217;s head just then.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s that long-legged
fellow we were after?&#8221; he cried.
&#8220;It was all his fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cubs scrambled to their
feet and looked this way and
that way, but Peter Rabbit was
nowhere to be seen.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> ever there were two foolish-feeling
little Bears, the twins of
Buster Bear were those two.
And they looked just as foolish as
they felt. While they had been
fighting, Peter Rabbit had made
the most of his chance and the
best use of his legs and had
disappeared. Where he had gone
neither Boxer nor Woof-Woof had
the least idea.</p>

<p>They looked this way. They
looked that way. They peered
under the pile of brush. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
even tore it all apart. There
was no sign of Peter. As a
matter of fact, Peter was far
away, headed straight for the
dear Old Briar-patch; and Peter
was chuckling. The instant those
cubs began to fight, all fear had
left Peter. He knew then that
he had nothing more to fear
from them.</p>

<p>&#8220;People who lose their tempers
lose their wits with them,&#8221;
chuckled Peter. &#8220;I couldn&#8217;t
have done that better if I had
planned it. My, how those cubs
have grown! I think I&#8217;ll keep
away from that part of the Green
Forest. Yes, sir, I&#8217;ll keep away
from there.&#8221; And in that decision
Peter showed that he wasn&#8217;t yet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
too old to learn a lesson and
gain wisdom therefrom.</p>

<p>At last the twins gave up
looking for Peter. &#8220;I-I-I hope
I didn&#8217;t hurt you,&#8221; said Boxer
meekly, as he saw Woof-Woof
rub her nose again. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t
mean to.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you did,&#8221; retorted Woof-Woof.
&#8220;You did mean to hurt
me. I know, because I know
you felt just as I did, and I
meant to hurt you. I-I-I hope
I didn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much,&#8221; replied Boxer
sheepishly as he felt of one ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess we are even. That
fellow we didn&#8217;t catch probably
is laughing at us and will tell
everybody he meets what silly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
little Bears we are. I guess it
doesn&#8217;t pay to fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That depends,&#8221; said a deep,
grumbly-rumbly voice. The twins
turned to find Mother Bear looking
at them. &#8220;It never pays to
fight excepting for your rights,
but the one who will not fight
for his rights never will get far
in the Great World. Neither
will the one who is always ready
to fight over nothing. Now what
have you been fighting about?&#8221;</p>

<p>Feeling more and more foolish
every minute, the twins told
Mother Bear all about Peter
Rabbit, how they had tried to
catch him, and how they had lost
their tempers when they bumped
into each other.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>Mother Bear&#8217;s eyes twinkled,
but she took care that the twins
should not see that twinkle.</p>

<p>&#8220;You ought to be spanked,
both of you,&#8221; said she sternly;
&#8220;and the next time I know of
you fighting you will be spanked.
I won&#8217;t spank you this time,
because I hope you have learned
a lesson. When two people fight
over a thing, some one else is
likely to get it. People who lose
their tempers usually lose more,
just as you lost your chance to
catch Peter Rabbit. Now all the
Green Forest will laugh at you,
and Peter Rabbit will boast that
he was smarter than two Bears.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll get even with him yet,&#8221;
muttered Boxer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; declared
Mother Bear. &#8220;Peter Rabbit will
never give you a chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>And this is exactly what Peter
Rabbit had resolved himself.</p>

<small>THE TWINS MEET THEIR FATHER</small></h2></div>

<div class="stanza">

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Boxer</span> and Woof-Woof had begun
to wonder if they and their
mother were the only Bears in the
Green Forest. So far they had seen
no other. Then one day as they
were playing about near the Laughing
Brook, while Mother Bear was
busy a little way off tearing open
an old stump after ants, Woof-Woof
discovered a footprint. She showed
it to Boxer. Then the two little cubs
sat up and stared at each other and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
their little eyes were very round
with wonder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mother Bear didn&#8217;t make that
footprint,&#8221; whispered Boxer as if he
were afraid of being overheard.
&#8220;Who do you suppose did?&#8221;</p>

<p>Woof-Woof moved a little nearer
to Boxer. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t any idea,&#8221;
she whispered back, and hurriedly
glanced all around. &#8220;It wasn&#8217;t
Mother Bear, for there is one of her
footprints right over there, and it is
different. There must be a great
big stranger around here.&#8221;</p>

<p>The twins drew very close together
and stood up that they might
better stare in every direction. They
were a little frightened at the
thought that a big stranger might
be near. Then they remembered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
that Mother Bear was only a little
way off, and at once they felt better.
They saw no stranger. Everything
about them seemed just as it should
be. They cocked their little ears to
listen. All they heard was the
sound of Mother Bear&#8217;s great claws
tearing open that old stump, the
cawing of Blacky the Crow far in
the distance, the gurgle of the
Laughing Brook, and the whispering
of the Merry Little Breezes in
the tree tops.</p>

<p>Now not even Peter Rabbit has
more curiosity than has a little Bear.
Presently Boxer dropped down to
all fours and approached that footprint.
Already he had learned
that his ears were better than his
eyes and his nose was better than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
his ears. His eyes had told him
nothing. His ears had told him
nothing. Now he would try his
nose.</p>

<p>He sniffed at that footprint and
the hair along his shoulders rose a
little. His nose told him that that
footprint was made by a Bear he
never had seen. There wasn&#8217;t any
question about it. It told him that
the stranger had passed this way
only a short time before. A great
desire to see that stranger took
possession of Boxer. Curiosity was
stronger than fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s follow his tracks; perhaps
we can see him,&#8221; whispered
Boxer to Woof-Woof, and started
along with his nose to the ground.</p>

<p>Now whatever one twin did, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
other did. So Woof-Woof followed
her brother. One behind the other,
their noses to the ground, the twins
stole through the Green Forest.
Every once in a while Boxer sat up
to look and listen. When he did
this, Woof-Woof did the same thing.
It was very exciting. It was so exciting
that they quite forgot Mother
Bear and that they had been told
not to go away. So they got farther
and farther from where Mother Bear
was at work.</p>

<p>And then, without any warning
at all, a great Bear stepped out
from behind a fallen tree. He
wore a black coat, and he was just
about the size of Mother Bear. Of
course you know who it was. It
was Buster Bear. For the first time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in their short lives the twins saw
their father and he saw them. But
the twins didn&#8217;t know that he was
their father, and he didn&#8217;t know
that they were his children. Things
like that happen in the Green
Forest.</p>

<small>THE TWINS TAKE TO A TREE</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">Run while you may, nor hesitate</div>
<div class="verse">Lest you should prove to be too late.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mother</span> Bear is a very wise
mother. One of the first things
she taught the twins was that
safety is the first and most important
thing. Then she taught
them that it is better to run
away from possible danger than
to wait to make sure of the
danger.</p>

<p>&#8220;No harm comes of running
away,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but if you
wait you may discover your
danger too late to run. It is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
better to run away a hundred
times without cause than to be
too late once in time of real
danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>So when the twins suddenly
came face to face with Buster
Bear for the first time, they did
just the right thing. For a second
or two they stared at him in
frightened surprise, then they
turned and ran.</p>

<p>Do you think it queer that the
twins didn&#8217;t know their own
father? And do you think it
even more queer that Buster Bear
didn&#8217;t know his own children?
Just remember that they had
never seen him and he had never
seen them before. For more than
three months after they were born<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
they hadn&#8217;t been out from under
that great windfall in the Green
Forest. When they did come out,
Buster Bear had been in another
part of the Green Forest. Mother
Bear had warned him to keep
away from that windfall, and
Buster had obeyed. So Boxer
and Woof-Woof had known
nothing about their father and
Buster had known nothing about
the twins.</p>

<p>Now when Buster saw those
cubs, not knowing they were his
own, he was filled with sudden
anger. He didn&#8217;t want any more
Bears in the Green Forest. He
wanted the Green Forest just for
himself and Mrs. Bear. Those
young Bears were likely to make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
a great deal of trouble. Anyway,
they would need a lot of food,
and this would mean that it
would be just so much harder
for him to get enough to satisfy
his own big appetite. So after
the first surprised stare Buster
growled. It was a grumbly-rumbly
growl deep down in his
throat. The twins heard it as
they started to run, and it was
the most awful sound they ever
had heard.</p>

<p>Straight to the nearest tall tree
ran the twins, and up they
scrambled. Chatterer the Red
Squirrel could hardly have gone
up that tree faster. Somehow
they felt safer in a tree than on
the ground. Buster Bear walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
over to the foot of the tree and
looked up at the cubs. They
were fat, were those cubs. They
were very fat.</p>

<p>&#8220;They look good enough to
eat,&#8221; thought Buster, as he stood
up at the foot of the tree, looking
up at Boxer and Woof-Woof.
&#8220;They would make me
a very good dinner. They have
no business here, anyway. I&#8217;ve
been living on roots and such
things so long that a little fresh
meat would taste good. If I go
up after them, I can do two
things at once, rid the Green
Forest of a pair of troublesome
youngsters who are bound to
make trouble, and get a good
dinner. I believe I&#8217;ll do it.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>Of course this was very dreadful,
but you know Buster didn&#8217;t
know that those cubs were his
own. They meant no more to
him than did Peter Rabbit, and
you know he wouldn&#8217;t have
hesitated an instant to gobble up
Peter if he had had the chance.</p>

<p>Buster looked all around to
make sure that no one saw him.
Then he dug his great claws into
that tree and started to climb up.</p>

<small>MOTHER COMES TO THE RESCUE</small></h2></div>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">In all the world, below, above,</div>
<div class="verse">The greatest thing is mother love.</div>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> love of a mother is wonderful
beyond all things. There is
nothing to compare with it. There
is nothing it will not attempt to do.
There is no danger it will not face.
There is no sacrifice it will not
make. It is the most beautiful,
the most perfect of all things.</p>

<p>Boxer and Woof-Woof had
thought that in climbing a tall tree
they were making themselves safe.
It had not entered their funny little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
heads that great big Buster Bear
would climb that tree. So you can
imagine how terribly frightened
they were when Buster started up
that tree after them. They scrambled
up and up until they were
just as high as they could get.
There they clung with feet and
hands, the worst scared little folks
in all the Green Forest.</p>

<p>Now little Bears are much like
little boys and girls in very many
ways, and one of these is their faith
in mother. Another is that when
they are frightened or in trouble
they cry and yell for mother.</p>

<p>That is just what Boxer and
Woof-Woof did now. The instant
they saw Buster, they began to
whimper and cry softly, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
kept it up as they scrambled up
the trunk of that tree. But when
they saw Buster Bear climbing up
after them, they simply opened
their months and bawled.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mamma! Mamma-a-a!&#8221; yelled
Boxer, at the top of his lungs.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-o-o, mamma-a-a!&#8221; screamed
Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>Now fortunately for the twins,
Mother Bear was not so far away
that she couldn&#8217;t hear them. By
the sound of their voices she knew
that this was no ordinary trouble
they were in. Terror was in the
sound of those voices. Those
twins were in danger. There was
no doubt about it. That danger
might be danger for her as well,
but she didn&#8217;t give that a thought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
She plunged straight in the direction
from which those cries were
coming, and she didn&#8217;t stop to pick
her way. She crashed straight
through brush and branches in her
way, jumped over logs, and broke
down young trees.</p>

<p>At the sound of the first crash
made by Mother Bear as she started
for those cubs, Buster Bear stopped
climbing. He turned his head and
looked anxiously in that direction,
his little ears cocked to catch every
sound. At the second crash Buster
Bear decided that that was no place
for him. He didn&#8217;t stop to climb
down. He simply let go and
dropped. Yes, sir, that is what he
did. He let go and dropped.</p>

<p>It was quite a way to the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>,
but the ground was where Buster
Bear wanted to be, and he wanted
to be there right away. He
wanted to be there before whoever
was coming could reach that tree.
And the quickest way of getting
there was to drop. A few bruises
and a shaking up were nothing to
Buster Bear just then.</p>

<p>The grunt he gave when he hit
the ground even the twins heard
way up in the top of the tree. It
made them stop bawling for a minute
to wonder if Buster had been
killed. But Buster hadn&#8217;t been
killed. Goodness, no! In an instant
he was on his feet and running
away so fast that even Lightfoot
the Deer would have had to
do his best to keep up with him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
And over his shoulder Buster Bear
was throwing frightened glances.</p>

<p>He was not out of sight when
Mother Bear burst out from among
the trees. She saw him instantly.
With a roar of rage, she started
after Buster. Buster had seemed
to be moving fast, but it was nothing
compared to the way he moved
when he heard that roar.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> instant they saw Mother
Bear, the twins stopped bawling.
Nothing could harm them now.
They knew it. Mother would
take care of them. Of that there
wasn&#8217;t a shadow of a doubt in
the minds of Boxer and Woof-Woof.
Hanging on with every
claw of hands and feet, they
leaned out as far as they could to
see what would happen to that
great black Bear who had frightened
them so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>But nothing happened to Buster
Bear for the very good reason
that he didn&#8217;t wait for anything
to happen. Buster was doing no
waiting at all. In fact, he was
moving so fast and at the same
time trying to watch behind him
that he didn&#8217;t even pick his path.
He bumped into trees and stumbled
over logs in a way that to say
the least was not at all dignified.
But Buster was in too much of a
hurry to think of dignity. There
was something about the looks of
Mother Bear as she tore after him
that made him feel sure that he
would find it much pleasanter in
another part of the Green Forest,
and he was in a hurry to get there.</p>

<p>Mother Bear didn&#8217;t follow him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
far, only just far enough to make
sure that he intended to keep right
on going. Then, growling dreadful
threats, she hurried back to the
tree in which the cubs were.
Boxer and Woof-Woof were already
scrambling down as fast as
they could, whimpering a little,
for though they felt wholly safe
now, they were not yet over their
fright. She reached the foot of
the tree just as they reached the
ground.</p>

<p>She sat up and the twins rushed
to her and snuggled as close to her
as they could get. Mother Bear
put a big arm around each and
patted them gently. It was surprising
how gentle great big
Mother Bear could be.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8220;Wha-wha-what would that awful
fellow have done to us?&#8221;
asked Woof-Woof, crowding still
closer to Mother Bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eaten you,&#8221; growled Mother
Bear, and little cold shivers ran
all over Woof-Woof and Boxer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate him!&#8221; declared Boxer.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I!&#8221; cried Woof-Woof.
&#8220;I think he is dreadful, and I
hope we&#8217;ll never, never, never, see
him again!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will,&#8221; replied Mother
Bear. &#8220;I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll see
him again right away, for he knows
it isn&#8217;t wise for him to hang
around here when I am about.
But by and by, when you are bigger,
you will see him often. The
fact is, he is your father.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>&#8220;What!&#8221; screamed the twins,
quite horrified. &#8220;That dreadful
fellow our father!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just so,&#8221; growled Mrs. Bear.
&#8220;Just so. And he isn&#8217;t dreadful
at all. You mustn&#8217;t speak of
your father that way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if it isn&#8217;t dreadful for a
father to want to eat his own children,
I guess I don&#8217;t know what
dreadful means,&#8221; declared Boxer in
a most decided tone. &#8220;I call it
dreadful, and I hate him. I do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Softly, Boxer. Softly,&#8221; chided
Mother Bear. &#8220;You see, he didn&#8217;t
know you were his children. He
knows it now, but until he saw me
coming to your rescue he didn&#8217;t
know it. He never had seen you
before. You were simply two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
tempting-looking little strangers
who, if I do say it, look good
enough to eat.&#8221; She squeezed them
and patted them fondly. &#8220;His
name,&#8221; she added, &#8220;is Buster Bear.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> is why people so often
cannot agree. Each sees a thing
from a different point of view
and so it looks different. Just
take the case of Buster Bear
and the twins. When Boxer and
Woof-Woof looked down at Buster
Bear climbing the tree after
them, he seemed a terrible fellow.
But when they saw him running
from Mother Bear, he didn&#8217;t
seem so very terrible after all.</p>

<p>Of course it was a great surprise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to the cubs to learn that
Buster Bear was their father.
They couldn&#8217;t think or talk of
anything else the rest of that day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you notice what a beautiful
black coat he had?&#8221; asked
Boxer, glancing at his own little
black coat with pride.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like brown better myself,&#8221;
sniffed Woof-Woof, whose coat
was brown like their mother&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&#8220;He really is very big and
handsome,&#8221; continued Boxer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And a coward,&#8221; sniffed Woof-Woof.
&#8220;You noticed how he ran
from Mother Bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was because he discovered
his mistake about us.
Of course he wouldn&#8217;t fight then,&#8221;
Boxer said in defense.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care, I think he is
a poor sort of a father, and I&#8217;m
not a bit proud of him,&#8221; persisted
Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I grow up to be as big
and handsome as he is. I&#8217;m glad
my coat is black,&#8221; Boxer declared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh!&#8221; sniffed Woof-Woof.
&#8220;A black coat may cover a
black heart. We are lucky not
to be inside that black coat of
his right now.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was true, and Boxer
knew it. He wisely attempted
no reply. &#8220;Where do you suppose
he lives?&#8221; he ventured.</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t the least idea, but
I hope it isn&#8217;t near here. I
don&#8217;t want to see him again ever,&#8221;
retorted Woof-Woof.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>&#8220;But he is your own father,&#8221;
protested Boxer.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. If all fathers
are like him, I don&#8217;t think much
of fathers,&#8221; sputtered Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>Mother Bear came up just
in time to hear this. &#8220;Tut, tut,
tut,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I won&#8217;t have
you talking that way about your
father. By and by you will
know him better and learn to
respect him. He is the handsomest
Bear I have ever seen,
and some day you will be proud
that he is your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like mothers best,&#8221; confided
Woof-Woof, snuggling up to
Mother Bear. Mother Bear&#8217;s face
suddenly grew very stern. &#8220;I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
want to know,&#8221; said she, &#8220;how
he happened to find you up
that tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We-we met him and he chased
us up that tree,&#8221; explained Boxer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And how did you happen
to meet him?&#8221; persisted Mother
Bear. &#8220;That tree was a long
way from where I left you at
play and charged you to stay.&#8221;</p>

<p>The cubs hung their heads.</p>

<p>&#8220;We-we-we found his tracks
and followed them,&#8221; stammered
Boxer in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;And got a fright, which was
no more than you deserved,&#8221;
declared Mother Bear. &#8220;You ought
to be spanked, both of you,
for your disobedience. Now you
see what comes of not minding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
I hope the fright you have had
will be a lesson you never will
forget. And don&#8217;t let me hear
you say another word against
your father.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m,&#8221; replied the twins
meekly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wonderful</span> days were these
for the twins, Boxer and Woof-Woof.
Every day there was
something new to see or hear or
taste or smell or feel. And then
there had to be tucked away in
each funny little head where it
could not be forgotten the memory
of exactly how each of these new
things looked or sounded or tasted
or smelled or felt. Mother Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was very particular about this.
So, though the twins didn&#8217;t know
it, they were really going to school
all the time that they thought
they were simply having good
times and wonderful adventures.</p>

<p>One day Mother Bear led them
over to the pond of Paddy the
Beaver. How the cubs did stare
when they got their first glimpse
of that pond. The Laughing
Brook was the only water they
were acquainted with, and in that
part of the Green Forest it was
narrow and the pools were very
small. They had not supposed
there was so much water in all
the Great World as now lay
before them in the pond of Paddy
the Beaver.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>Mother Bear led the way
straight to one end of the dam
which Paddy had built to make
that pond. She started across
that dam. The twins followed.
Every few steps they stopped to
wonder at that pond. The Merry
Little Breezes of Old Mother West
Wind were dancing across the
middle of it and making little
ripples that sparkled as the Jolly
Little Sunbeams kissed them.</p>

<p>Close to the dam the water
was smooth, for the Merry Little
Breezes had not come in there.
Boxer and Woof-Woof looked
down. Perhaps you can guess
how they felt when they saw two
little Bears of just their size staring
back at them. The twins<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
were so surprised that they backed
away hastily. The stranger cubs
did exactly the same thing. This
gave Boxer and Woof-Woof confidence.
They moved forward to
the very edge of the dam, and
there they sat up.</p>

<p>When they did this they lost
sight of the other little Bears.
They didn&#8217;t know what to make
of it. Then Boxer happened to
look down in the water. There
were the stranger cubs sitting up
and doing exactly as he and
Woof-Woof did. Stranger still,
one of them was dressed in black
and one in brown, and the latter
looked so exactly like his sister
that Boxer turned to look at her,
to make sure that she was beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
him there on the edge of the
dam.</p>

<p>Boxer dropped down on all
fours. The little stranger in
black did the same thing. It
provoked Boxer. Like a flash
he struck at that stranger. Quick
as he was, the stranger was as
quick. Boxer saw a stout little
paw exactly like his own coming
toward him. He dodged, and as
he did so his own swiftly moving
little paw struck&mdash;nothing but
water. It so surprised Boxer
that he lost his balance, and in
he tumbled with a splash.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/i_120fp.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">It was the first time they ever had been in
the water all over.</span> <i>Page 121.</i></p>

<p>Now Woof-Woof had been so
intent on the little stranger in
brown that she had paid no
attention to Boxer. Woof-Woof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
was rather better-natured than her
small brother. She had no desire
to quarrel with these strangers.
Slowly, very slowly, she stretched
her head toward the little stranger
in brown. The latter did just
the same thing. They were just
about to touch noses when Boxer
fell in. The splash startled Woof-Woof
so that she lost her balance,
and in she went headfirst with a
splash quite equal to that of
Boxer.</p>

<p>If ever there were two frightened
little Bears, they were the
twins. It was the first time they
ever had been in the water all
over. They tried to run, but
there was nothing for their feet
to touch. This frightened them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
still more, and they made their
legs go faster. Then they discovered
that they were moving
through the water; they were
swimming! they were getting their
first bath and their first swimming
lesson at the same time.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> wouldn&#8217;t be quite truthful to
say that the twins enjoyed that first
bath and swim. They didn&#8217;t. In
the first place, they had gone in all
over without the least intention of
doing so. In fact, they had tumbled
in. This had frightened them.
They had opened their mouths to
yell and had swallowed more water
than was at all pleasant. Some of
it had gone down the wrong way,
and this had choked them. No,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the twins didn&#8217;t enjoy that first
bath and swim at all.</p>

<p>They climbed out on the dam of
Paddy the Beaver and shook themselves,
making the water fly from
their coats in a shower. Mother
Bear had started back at the sound
of the splashes they had made when
they fell in, but seeing them safe,
she grinned and went on about her
own affairs.</p>

<p>&#8220;This has saved me some
trouble,&#8221; muttered she. &#8220;I probably
would have had hard work
to get them into the water without
throwing them in. Now they will
not be afraid of it. An accident
sometimes proves a blessing.&#8221;</p>

<p>Meanwhile the twins had shaken
themselves as nearly dry as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
could and were now sitting down
side by side, gravely staring at the
water. There was something very
mysterious about that water. They
felt that somehow it had played
them a trick; that it was its fault
that they had fallen in.</p>

<p>Suddenly Boxer remembered the
two little stranger Bears. What
had become of them? In the excitement
he had forgotten all about
them. He remembered that it was
while striking at one of them he
had fallen in. That little Bear had
struck at him at the same time.
Boxer couldn&#8217;t recall being hit or
striking anything but that water.
Then he had tumbled in.</p>

<p>But had he tumbled in? Hadn&#8217;t
he been pulled in? Hadn&#8217;t that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
other little Bear grabbed him and
pulled him in? The instant that
idea popped into his head, Boxer
was sure that that was how it all
came about. He glared as much
as such a little Bear could glare all
around in search of that other little
Bear, but no other little Bear but
his sister Woof-Woof was to be seen.
She was solemnly gazing at the
water.</p>

<p>Now of course the splashing of
the twins had made a lot of ripples
on the surface of the water and
these destroyed all reflections.
But by now the water had become
calm again. Woof-Woof happened
to look down into it almost at her
feet. A little brown Bear looked
back at her. It was the same little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
brown Bear with whom she had
tried to touch noses just before she
fell into the water.</p>

<p>Woof-Woof poked Boxer and
pointed down at the water. Boxer
looked. There was that same provoking
little black Bear. Boxer
lifted his lips and snarled. The
other little Bear lifted his lips in
exactly the same way, but Boxer
heard no sound save his own snarl.
Boxer opened his mouth and showed
all his teeth. The other little Bear
opened his mouth and showed all
his teeth. Whatever Boxer did,
the other little Bear did. And it
was just the same with Woof-Woof
and the little brown Bear.</p>

<p>Boxer was tempted to strike at
that little Bear as he had before,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
but just as he was about to do it,
he remembered what happened
before. This caused him to back
away hastily. He wouldn&#8217;t give
that other fellow a chance to pull
him in again. When he backed
away, the other little Bear did the
same thing. In a few steps he disappeared.
Boxer cautiously stole
forward. The other little Bear
came to meet him.</p>

<p>If ever there were two puzzled
little Bears they were Boxer and
Woof-Woof, as they tried to get
acquainted with their own reflections
in the pond of Paddy the
Beaver.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wherever</span> Mother Bear went
the twins went. In the first place
they were so full of life and mischief
that Mother Bear didn&#8217;t dare
leave them for any length of time.
Then, too, it was good for them to
be with her, for thus they learned
many things that they could not
have learned otherwise.</p>

<p>But there were times when Mother
Bear found Boxer and Woof-Woof
very much in the way. Such times
she was likely to send them up a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
tree and tell them to remain there
until her return. She always felt
that they were quite safe so long as
they were up in a tree, where there
was no real mischief they could get
into.</p>

<p>It happened that one morning
Mrs. Bear sent them up a tall pine
tree with strict orders to stay there
until her return. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare
come down from that tree until I
tell you you may,&#8221; said she in her
deep, grumbly-rumbly voice, as the
twins scrambled up the tree.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&#8217;m,&#8221; replied Woof-Woof
meekly. But Boxer didn&#8217;t say a
word.</p>

<p>No sooner was their mother out
of sight than Boxer proposed that
they go down on the ground to play.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
&#8220;She won&#8217;t be back for some time,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the time she does return, we
will be back up here and she will
never know anything about it.
Come on, Woof-Woof.&#8221;</p>

<p>Woof-Woof shook her head.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to stay right here,&#8221;
said she, &#8220;and you&#8217;d better do the
same thing, Boxer. If you get
caught, you&#8217;ll get a spanking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pooh! Who cares for a spanking!&#8221;
exclaimed Boxer. &#8220;Besides,
I&#8217;m not going to get one. There
isn&#8217;t any sense in making us stay
up in this tree. We can&#8217;t have
any fun up here. Come on down
and play hide-and-seek.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Woof-Woof wouldn&#8217;t do it.
&#8220;You&#8217;re afraid!&#8221; declared Boxer.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid!&#8221; retorted Woof-Woof
indignantly. &#8220;You heard
what Mother Bear said and you
better mind. You may be sorry if
you don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fraidy! Fraidy!&#8221; jeered Boxer,
as he slid down the trunk of the tree.</p>

<p>Now Boxer hadn&#8217;t intended to go
more than a few feet from the foot
of that tree. He wanted to be near
enough to scramble up again at the
first hint of Mother Bear&#8217;s approach.
But there was nothing to do down
there, and without Woof-Woof to
play with he found it very dull.</p>

<p>Little Bears are very restless and
uneasy. Boxer walked round and
round that tree because he could
think of nothing else to do. By and
by a Merry Little Breeze happened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
along and tickled his nose with a
strange smell. The Merry Little
Breezes were always doing that.
Boxer used to wonder if he ever
would learn all the smells of the
Green Forest.</p>

<p>Not having anything else to do
just then, Boxer decided that he
would follow up that smell and find
out where and what it came from.
Off he started, his inquisitive little
nose sniffing the air. After a little
that smell grew fainter and fainter,
and finally there wasn&#8217;t any. You
see, the Merry Little Breezes were
carrying it in quite another direction.</p>

<p>Boxer turned to go back. He
thought he was going straight toward
that tree where Mother Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
had left him. But he wasn&#8217;t, and
by and by he discovered that he
was lost. Then he began to run,
and as he ran he whimpered.
Suddenly out from behind a tree
stepped Mother Bear. Boxer was
so glad to see her he quite forgot
that he had disobeyed.</p>

<p>But Mother Bear didn&#8217;t forget,
&#8220;What are you doing here?&#8221; she
demanded. Boxer hung his head
and didn&#8217;t say a word.</p>

<p>&#8220;A cub who disobeys must be
punished,&#8221; said Mother Bear, and
she promptly gave Boxer the first
real spanking he ever had received.
How he did wish he had stayed up
in that tree with Woof-Woof.</p>

this. He had bawled lustily
and then he had whimpered softly
all the way back to that tree
in which Woof-Woof had obediently
remained. Until he reached
the foot of that tree and looked
up at Woof-Woof, there had been
no sulkiness in Boxer.</p>

<p>But when he saw Woof-Woof
grinning down at him as if she
were glad of all his trouble,
Boxer suddenly felt that he was
the most abused little Bear in
all the Great World.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you wish you hadn&#8217;t
tried to be so smart?&#8221; whispered
Woof-Woof, when at Mother
Bear&#8217;s command she had joined
Boxer on the ground. &#8220;I heard<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
you bawling. I guess next time
you&#8217;ll be good like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was too much for Boxer,
and he struck at Woof-Woof.</p>

<p>Instantly he felt the sting of
Mother Bear&#8217;s big paw. It made
him squeal. Woof-Woof grinned
at him again, but she took care
that Mother Bear shouldn&#8217;t see
that grin. Woof-Woof actually
seemed to enjoy seeing Boxer in
trouble. Little folks and some
big ones often are that way.</p>

<p>So, because with Mother Bear
there he had no chance to show
his spite to Woof-Woof, Boxer
sulked. He wanted to be by
himself just to pity himself. Instead
of walking close at the
heels of Mother Bear as usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>,
he allowed Woof-Woof to take
that place, and he tagged on
behind just as far back as he
dared to. Once in a while Woof-Woof
would turn her head and
make a face at him. Boxer pretended
not to see this.</p>

<p>When they stopped to rest,
Boxer curled up by himself and
pretended to have a nap, while
all the time he was just sulking.
When after a while Woof-Woof
tried to make friends with him,
he would have nothing to do
with her. Boxer was actually
having a good time being miserable.
People can get that way
sometimes.</p>

<p>Finally Mother Bear lost patience
and sent him in under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
great windfall to the bedroom
where he was born. &#8220;Stay in
there until you get over being
sulky,&#8221; said she. &#8220;Don&#8217;t put
foot outside until you can be
pleasant.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Boxer crept under the
great windfall to the bedroom
where he had spent his babyhood.
There he curled up and was
more sulky then ever. He said
to himself that he hated Mother
Bear and he hated his sister,
Woof-Woof. He didn&#8217;t do anything
of the kind. He loved
both dearly. But he tried to
make himself believe that he
hated them. People in the sulks
are very fond of doing things
like that.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>So while Woof-Woof went over
to the Laughing Brook with
Mother Bear, under the great
windfall Boxer lay and sulked
and tried to think of some way
of getting even with Mother Bear
and Woof-Woof.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Boxer</span> lay curled up in a corner
of the bedroom under the great
windfall, and there he sulked and
sulked and sulked and tried to
make himself believe he was the
worst treated little Bear in all the
Great World. But sulking all
alone isn&#8217;t any fun at all. No one
can truly enjoy being sulky, with
no one to see it. So in spite of
himself Boxer was soon wondering
what Woof-Woof and Mother Bear
were doing. He had seen them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
start off toward the Laughing Brook
and though he wouldn&#8217;t own up to
it, even to himself, he wished that
he was with them. He dearly
loved to play along the Laughing
Brook.</p>

<p>When he could stand it no longer,
Boxer stole out to the entrance and
poked his head out from under the
great windfall. There he stood for
the longest time looking, listening,
smelling. Everything looked just
as usual. There were no strange
sounds. The Merry Little Breezes
brought him no new smells. There
were no signs of Mother Bear and
Woof-Woof. He didn&#8217;t know
whether they had gone up the
Laughing Brook or down the
Laughing Brook. He tried to pretend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
that he didn&#8217;t care where they
were or what they were doing.</p>

<p>But he didn&#8217;t succeed. You
know it isn&#8217;t often you can really
and truly fool yourself. You may
fool other people, but not yourself.
So after a while Boxer gave up trying
to pretend he didn&#8217;t care. And
then sulkiness gave way to temper,
bad temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;I-I-I&#8217;ll go way, way off in the
Great World and never come back.
Then I guess Mother Bear and
Woof-Woof will be sorry and wish
they had been good to me,&#8221; muttered
Boxer.</p>

<p>He stood up for an instant to
look and listen. Then that silly
little Bear scampered off as fast as
he could go, without paying any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
attention at all to his direction.
His one thought was to get as far
as possible from the great windfall
before Mother Bear should return.
He would show Mother Bear that
he was too big to be spanked and
sent to bed. He would show Woof-Woof
that he could take care of
himself and didn&#8217;t need to tag along
after Mother Bear.</p>

<p>So Boxer ran and ran until his
little legs grew tired. The only
use he made of his eyes was to keep
looking behind him to see if Mother
Bear was after him. Not once did
he use them to take note of the way
in which he was going. So it was
that when at last he stopped, because
his legs ached and he was out
of breath, Boxer was as completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
lost as a little Bear could be. He
didn&#8217;t know it then, but he was.
He was to find it out later.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now,&#8221; said Boxer, talking to
himself as he rested, &#8220;I guess
Mother Bear will be sorry she
spanked me. And I guess Woof-Woof
will wish she hadn&#8217;t laughed
at me and made fun of me. Maybe
they&#8217;ll be so sorry they&#8217;ll cry. If
they come to look for me, I&#8217;ll hide
where they won&#8217;t ever find me.
Then they&#8217;ll be sorrier than ever
and I&#8217;ll be even with them. I
won&#8217;t go home until I am as big as
my father, Buster Bear. Then I
guess they&#8217;ll treat me nice.&#8221;</p>

<p>So Boxer rested and planned the
wonderful things he would do out
in the Great World and was glad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
he had run away from home. You
see, it was very pleasant there in
the Green Forest, and after all, if
he really wanted to, he could go
back home. That is what he
thought, anyway. You see, he
hadn&#8217;t the least idea yet that he
was lost.</p>

<small>CHATTERER HAS FUN WITH BOXER</small></h2></div>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> is Chatterer all over. In
all the Green Forest there is no
one who appears to enjoy mischief
so thoroughly as does Chatterer
the Red Squirrel. And there is
no one more ready to take a
chance when it offers.</p>

<p>It happened that Chatterer discovered
Boxer, the runaway little
Bear, as he rested and planned
what he would do out in the Great
World. Chatterer kept quiet until
he was sure that Boxer was alone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
that Mother Bear and Woof-Woof
were nowhere near. When he was
sure of this, Chatterer guessed just
what had happened. He guessed
that Boxer had run away. You
know Chatterer is one of the
sharpest and shrewdest of all the
little people in the Green Forest.</p>

<p>Chatterer grinned. &#8220;I believe,&#8221;
said he to himself, &#8220;that that silly
little Bear has run away and is
lost. If he isn&#8217;t lost, he ought to
be, and I&#8217;ll see to it that he is.
Yes, Sir, I&#8217;ll see to it that he is
properly lost. This is my chance
to get even for the fright he and
his sister gave me when they
chased me up a tree.&#8221;</p>

<p>Chatterer once more looked
everywhere to make sure no one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
else was about. Then he lightly
jumped over into the tree under
which Boxer was sitting. He took
care to make no sound. He crept
out on a limb directly over Boxer
and then he dropped a pine cone.</p>

<p>The pine cone hit Boxer right
on the end of his nose, and because
his nose is rather tender,
it hurt. It made the tears come.
Then, too, it was so unexpected
it startled Boxer. &#8220;Ouch!&#8221; he
cried, as he sprang to one side and
looked up to see where that cone
had come from.</p>

<p>When he saw Chatterer grinning
down at him, Boxer grew
very angry. That was the same
fellow he once had so nearly
caught in a tree top. This time he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
would catch him. Down came another
cone on Boxer&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t catch me! Can&#8217;t catch
me!&#8221; taunted Chatterer, in the
most provoking way.</p>

<p>Boxer growled and started up
that tree. &#8220;Can&#8217;t catch a flea!
Can&#8217;t catch me!&#8221; cried Chatterer
gleefully, as he looked down at
Boxer and made faces at him.</p>

<p>He waited until Boxer was halfway
up that tree then lightly ran
out to the end of a branch and
leaped across to a branch of the
next tree. From there he called
Boxer all sorts of names and made
fun of him until the little Bear
was so angry he hardly knew
what he was doing. Of course he
couldn&#8217;t jump across as Chatterer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
had. He was too big to run out
on a branch that way, even had
he dared try it. So there was
nothing to do but to scramble
down that tree and climb the
next one.</p>

<p>Boxer started down. When he
reached the ground, he found
Chatterer also on the ground.
&#8220;Can&#8217;t catch a flea! Can&#8217;t catch
me!&#8221; shouted Chatterer more provokingly
than ever.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can catch any Red Squirrel
that lives,&#8221; growled Boxer and
jumped at Chatterer. Chatterer
dodged and ran, Boxer after him.
Around trees and stumps, this
way, that way and the other way,
over logs, behind piles of brush
Chatterer led Boxer, until the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
was so out of breath he had
to stop.</p>

<p>Chatterer chuckled. &#8220;I guess
that now he is quite properly lost,&#8221;
said he to himself, as he ran up a
tree and dropped another cone on
Boxer. &#8220;I guess I&#8217;ve turned
him around so many times he
hasn&#8217;t any idea where home is or
anything else, for that matter.
I haven&#8217;t had so much fun for a
long time.&#8221;</p>

<p>He dropped another cone on
Boxer and then started off through
the tree tops, leaving Boxer all
alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Somehow</span> it is easier to be brave
when there are others about to see
how brave you are. It is a great
deal easier. To be brave when you
are all alone is quite another
matter. That is real bravery.
And to be alone and lost and brave
is the greatest bravery.</p>

<p>When Chatterer the Red Squirrel
raced away through the tree tops,
leaving Boxer alone to recover his
breath and rest his weary little legs,
he left a little Bear as completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
lost as ever a little Bear had been
since the beginning of the Great
World. Boxer didn&#8217;t know it
then. He was too busy getting his
breath and thinking how good it
was to rest to think of anything
else.</p>

<p>But after awhile Boxer felt
quite himself again, and once more
his anger at Chatterer the Red
Squirrel began to rise. Boxer
looked all about for Chatterer.
There was no sign of him. Boxer
swelled up with a feeling of
importance.</p>

<p>&#8220;That fellow must be hiding.
I guess I&#8217;ve given him a scare he
won&#8217;t forget in a hurry,&#8221; boasted
Boxer. How that would have
tickled Chatterer had he heard it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>Now that Chatterer had disappeared,
Boxer began to wonder
what he should do next. It
suddenly came to him that he was
in a strange place. None of the
trees or stumps about there was
familiar. There wasn&#8217;t a single
familiar thing to be seen anywhere.
A queer feeling of uneasiness crept
over Boxer. He couldn&#8217;t sit still.
No, Sir, he couldn&#8217;t sit still. He
didn&#8217;t know why, but he couldn&#8217;t.
So Boxer started on aimlessly. He
had nothing in particular to do and
nowhere in particular to go.</p>

<p>Presently he noticed the first of
the Black Shadows creeping
through the Green Forest. Somehow
those Black Shadows made
him think of home. Probably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Mother Bear and Woof-Woof were
back there by this time. He wondered
if they had missed him and
would start looking for him. If he
didn&#8217;t see them, how would he
ever know whether or not they
looked for him? How would he
ever know if he really did get even
with them by making them anxious?
Why not go back near the great
windfall and watch?</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course I won&#8217;t go home,&#8221;
muttered Boxer to himself, as he
shuffled along. &#8220;I&#8217;ve left home
for good. I&#8217;ll just go back and
hide near there where I can watch
and see all that happens. It will
be great fun to watch Mother Bear
and Woof-Woof hunt for me. I
guess I&#8217;ll hurry a little,&#8221; he added,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
as he noticed how the creeping
Black Shadows had increased. So
Boxer began to run.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t think home was so
far,&#8221; he panted at last, looking
fearfully over his shoulder at the
Black Shadows. &#8220;Ha, there is the
great windfall!&#8221; he added joyously,
as he spied a pile of fallen trees in
the distance.</p>

<p>He approached it carefully, stopping
often to look and listen, for
you know he didn&#8217;t want to be
seen by Mother Bear or Woof-Woof.
At least, he thought he didn&#8217;t want
to be seen by them, though way
down inside that was just what he
did want.</p>

<p>He heard no one and saw no one.
Presently he was close to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
windfall. A great longing for
home swept over him. He no
longer wanted to get even with anybody.
All he wanted was home
and mother. Perhaps Mother Bear
and Woof-Woof hadn&#8217;t returned
yet and he could slip in. Then
they would never know. Boxer
slipped around the old windfall to
where he thought the entrance was.
There wasn&#8217;t any! It wasn&#8217;t the
right windfall! Boxer knew right
then and there that he was lost,
that he was a lone, lost little Bear
out in the Great World. He sat
down and began to cry.</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">More</span> and more Black Shadows
crept through the Green Forest
and all around Boxer, the lone,
lost little Bear, as he sat crying
and wishing with all his might
that he never, never had thought
of running away. He wanted to
be back in the great windfall
which had been his home. He
wanted Mother Bear. &#8220;Boo, hoo,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
hoo,&#8221; sobbed the little Bear,
&#8220;I would just as soon have a
spanking. I wouldn&#8217;t mind it
at all if only I had my Mother.
Boo, hoo, hoo.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now there are many keen ears in
the Green Forest after dark, and no
one can cry there and not be
heard. Hooty the Owl was the
first to hear those sobs, and on
wings that made no sound at all he
flew to see what was the matter.
Perched on top of a tall stump
just back of Boxer, it didn&#8217;t
take Hooty long to understand
that this little Bear was lost.</p>

<p>&#8220;He needs a lesson,&#8221; thought
Hooty. &#8220;He needs a lesson. He
must have run away from home.
There is nothing around here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
for him to fear, but it will
be a good thing for him to think
here is. Here goes to give him
a scare he won&#8217;t forget in a
hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hooty drew a long breath and
then hooted as only he can. It
was so sudden, so loud and so
fierce, that it was enough to
frighten even one accustomed to
it. Boxer, who never had heard
that call close at hand before,
was so frightened he lost his
balance and fell over on his
back, his legs waving helplessly.
But he didn&#8217;t stay on his back.
I should say not! In a twinkling
he was on his feet and
running pell-mell.</p>

<p>Again rang out Hooty&#8217;s terrible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
hunting call, and Boxer
was sure that it was right at
his heels. As a matter of fact,
Hooty had not moved from the
tall stump. Headlong Boxer raced
through the woods. And because
it was quite dark and because
he was trying to look behind
him, instead of watching where
he was going, he pitched heels
over head down the bank of the
Laughing Brook, splash into a
little pool where Billy Mink was
fishing. The tumble and the wetting
frightened the little Bear
more than ever, and Billy Mink&#8217;s
angry snarl didn&#8217;t make him
feel any better. Without so much
as a glance at Billy Mink, he
scrambled to his feet and up the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
bank, sure that a new and terrible
enemy was at his heels.</p>

<p>More heedlessly than ever he
raced through the Green Forest
and just by chance entered the
thicket where Mrs. Lightfoot the
Deer had a certain wonderful
secret. Mrs. Lightfoot jumped,
making a crash of brush.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh-oo,&#8221; moaned Boxer, dodging
to one side and continuing
headlong. When he could run
no more, he crept under a pile
of brush and there he spent the
rest of the night, the most dreadful
night he ever had known or
was likely ever to know again.
Old Man Coyote happened along
and yelled as only he can, and
unless you know what it is, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
sound is quite dreadful. Boxer
never had heard it close at hand
before, and he didn&#8217;t recognize
it. He was sure that only a
great and terrible creature could
make such a dreadful noise, and
he shook with fear for an hour
after.</p>

<p>So all night long the little
Bear heard strange sounds and
imagined dreadful things and
couldn&#8217;t get a wink of sleep.
And all the time not once was
any real danger near him. There
wasn&#8217;t a single thing to be
afraid of.</p>

how glad Boxer was to see the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Jolly Little Sunbeams chase the
Black Shadows out of the Green
Forest the next morning. He
still felt frightened and very,
very lonesome, but things looked
very different by daylight, and he
felt very much braver and bolder.</p>

<p>First of all, he took a nap.
All night he had been awake,
for he had been too frightened to
sleep. That nap did him a world
of good. When he awoke, he
felt quite like another Bear. And
the first thing he thought of was
breakfast.</p>

<p>Now always before Mother Bear
had furnished Boxer with his
breakfast and with all his other
meals. But there was no Mother
Bear to do it this morning, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
his stomach was very empty. If
anything were to be put in it, he
was the one who would have to
put it there.</p>

<p>Just thinking of breakfast made
Boxer hungrier than ever. He
couldn&#8217;t lie still. He must have
something to eat, and he must
have it soon. He crawled out
from under the pile of brush,
shook himself, and tried to decide
where to go in search of a breakfast.
But being lost, of course
he had no idea which way to
turn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it doesn&#8217;t make much
difference,&#8221; grumbled Boxer.
&#8220;Whichever way I go, I guess
I&#8217;ll find something to eat if I
keep going long enough.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>So Boxer started out. And
because he had something on his
mind, something to do, he forgot
that he was lonesome, and he
forgot to be afraid. He just
couldn&#8217;t think of anything but
breakfast. Now while he never
had had to get food for himself
before, Boxer had watched Mother
Bear getting food and felt that
he knew just how to go about it.</p>

<p>He found a thoroughly rotted
old stump and pulled it apart.
It happened that he found
nothing there to eat. But a few
minutes later he forgot all about
this disappointment as he pulled
over a small log and saw ants
scurrying in every direction. He
promptly swept them into his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
mouth with his tongue and
smacked his lips at the taste of
them. He didn&#8217;t leave that place
until not another ant was to be
seen.</p>

<p>By and by he dug out certain
tender little roots and ate them.
How he knew where to dig for
them, he couldn&#8217;t have told himself.
He just knew, that was all.
Something inside him prompted
him to stop and dig, and he did
so.</p>

<p>Once he chased a Wood Mouse
into a hole and wasted a lot of
time trying to dig him out. But
it was exciting and a lot of fun,
so he didn&#8217;t mind much, even
when he had to give up. He
caught three or four beetles and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
near the Laughing Brook surprised
a young frog. Altogether
he made a very good breakfast.
And because he got it all himself,
with no help from any one,
he enjoyed it more than any
breakfast he could remember.
And suddenly he felt quite a
person of the Great World and
quite equal to taking care of
himself. He forgot that he had
cried for his mother only the
night before. The Great World
wasn&#8217;t such a bad place after
all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Having</span> succeeded in getting his
own breakfast, and a very good one
at that, Boxer felt quite set up, as
the saying is. He felt chesty.
That is to say, he felt big, self-important,
independent. For a
little cub who had cried most of the
night from loneliness and fear, Boxer
showed a surprising change. The
light of day, a full stomach, and the
feeling that he was able to take care<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
of himself had made a new Bear of
that little cub. Anyway he felt so
and thought so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid of anybody or
anything,&#8221; boasted the foolish little
Bear to himself, as he wandered
along through the Green Forest.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad I left home. I&#8217;m glad
I am out in the Great World. I
guess I know about all there is
to know. Anyway, I guess I
know all there is any need of
knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>As he said this, Boxer stood up
and swelled himself out and looked
so funny that Prickly Porky the
Porcupine, who happened along just
then, just had to chuckle down inside,
and this is something that
Prickly Porky seldom does.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>&#8220;That little rascal must have run
away from his mother, and he thinks
he is smart and knows all there is
to know. I don&#8217;t believe that even
Mother Bear could tell him anything
just now. She would be wasting
her breath. He needs a lesson or
two in practical experience. I believe
I&#8217;ll give him one just for his
own good,&#8221; thought Prickly Porky.</p>

<p>There was something almost like
a twinkle in Prickly Porky&#8217;s usually
dull eyes as he slowly waddled
straight toward Boxer. Boxer
heard the rustle of Prickly Porky&#8217;s
tail dragging through the leaves and
turned to see who was coming.
What he saw was, of course, the
stupidest-looking fellow in all the
Green Forest.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>It was the first time Boxer had
seen Prickly Porky, and he had no
idea who he was. Boxer stood up
and stared in the rudest and most
impolite manner. He wasn&#8217;t afraid.
This fellow was no bigger than he,
and he was too stupid-looking and
too slow to be dangerous.</p>

<p>Boxer was standing in a narrow
little path, and Prickly Porky was
coming up this little path straight
toward him. One of them would
have to step aside for the other.
It didn&#8217;t enter Boxer&#8217;s head that he
should be that one. As Prickly
Porky drew near, Boxer growled a
warning. It was the best imitation
of Mother Bear&#8217;s deep, grumbly-rumbly
growl that Boxer could
manage. It was hard work for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
Prickly Porky to keep from laughing
right out when he heard it.</p>

<p>But he acted just as if he didn&#8217;t
hear it. He kept right on. Then
he pretended to see Boxer for the
first time. &#8220;Step aside, little cub,
step aside and let me pass,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>To be called &#8220;little cub&#8221; just
when he was feeling so important
and grown-up was more than Boxer
could stand. His little eyes grew
red with anger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Step aside yourself,&#8221; he growled.
&#8220;Step aside yourself, if you don&#8217;t
want to get hurt.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prickly Porky didn&#8217;t step aside.
He kept right on coming. He didn&#8217;t
hurry, and he didn&#8217;t appear to be
in the least afraid. It was plain
that he expected Boxer to get out of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
his way. Boxer drew back his lips
and showed all his little white
teeth. Then he slowly reached out
one paw and prepared to strike
Prickly Porky on the side of the
head if he came any nearer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy Jay</span> happened along in
the Green Forest just in time to
see the meeting between Boxer
and Prickly Porky the Porcupine.
He saw at once that this was
the first time Boxer had seen
Prickly Porky, and that he had
no idea who this fellow in the
path was.</p>

<p>&#8220;If that little Bear has any
sense at all, he&#8217;ll be polite and
get out of Prickly Porky&#8217;s way,&#8221;
muttered Sammy. &#8220;But I&#8217;m<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
afraid he hasn&#8217;t any sense. He
looks to me all puffed up, as if
he thinks he knows all there is to
know. He&#8217;ll find out he doesn&#8217;t
in just about a minute if he stays
there. Hi, there! Don&#8217;t do that!
Don&#8217;t hit him!&#8221;</p>

<p>This last was screamed at
Boxer, who had stretched out a
paw as if to strike Prickly Porky
as soon as he was near enough.
But the warning came too late.
Prickly Porky had kept right on
coming along that little path, and
just as Sammy Jay screamed,
Boxer struck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow!&#8221; yelled Boxer, dancing
about and holding up one paw,
the paw with which he had
struck at Prickly Porky, and on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
his face was such a look of
amazement that Sammy Jay
laughed so that he nearly tumbled
from his perch.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wow, Wow!&#8221; yelled Boxer,
still dancing about and shaking
that paw.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull it out. Pull it out at
once, before it gets in deeper,&#8221;
commanded Sammy Jay, when he
could stop laughing long enough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pull what out?&#8221; asked
Boxer rather sullenly, for he
didn&#8217;t like being laughed at. No
one does when in trouble.</p>

<p>&#8220;That little spear that is sticking
in your paw,&#8221; replied Sammy.
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll have a
terribly sore paw.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boxer looked at his paw.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
Sure enough, there was one of
Prickly Porky&#8217;s little spears.
He took hold of it with his teeth
and started to pull. Then he
let go and shook his paw.
&#8220;Wow! that hurts!&#8221; he cried,
the tears in his eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course it hurts,&#8221; replied
Sammy Jay. &#8220;And if you don&#8217;t
do as I tell you and pull it out
now, it will hurt a great deal
more. That paw will get so sore
you can&#8217;t use it. It is a lucky
thing for you, young fellow, that
you were in too much of a hurry
and struck too soon. If you had
waited a second longer, you would
have filled your paw with those
little spears. What were you
thinking of, anyway? Don&#8217;t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
know that no one ever interferes
with Prickly Porky? It never
pays to. Even Buster Bear, big
as he is, is polite to Prickly
Porky.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boxer sat down and looked at
his paw carefully. That little
spear, or quill, was right in the
tenderest part. It must be pulled
out. Sammy Jay was right about
that. Boxer shut his teeth on
that little spear and jerked back
his head quick and hard. Out
came the little spear. Boxer
whimpered a little as he licked
the place where the little spear
had been. After he had licked
it a minute or two, that paw felt
better.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Prickly Porky had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
paid no attention whatever to the
little Bear. He had slowly waddled
on up the little path, quite
as if no one were about. He
was attending strictly to his own
business. But inside he was
chuckling.</p>

<p>&#8220;That scamp got off easy,&#8221; he
muttered. &#8220;It would have been
a good thing for him if he had
had a few more of those little spears
to pull out. I guess that in the
future he will take care to leave
me alone. There is nothing like
teaching the young to respect
their elders.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> memories of little folks are
short, so far as their troubles are
concerned. Hardly was Boxer, the
runaway little Bear, out of sight of
Prickly Porky the Porcupine than
his eyes, ears and nose were so busy
trying to discover new things that
he hardly thought of his recent
trouble. To be sure that paw from
which he had pulled one of Prickly
Porky&#8217;s little spears was sore, but
not enough so to worry him much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
And there were so many other
things to think about that he
couldn&#8217;t waste time on troubles
that were over.</p>

<p>So the little Bear wandered this
way and that way, as something
new caught his eyes or some
strange sound demanded to be
looked into. He was having a
wonderful time, for he felt that he
was indeed out in the Great World
and it was a wonderful and beautiful
place. If he thought of his
twin sister, Woof-Woof, at all, it
was to pity her tagging along at
Mother Bear&#8217;s heels and doing
only those things which Mother
Bear said she could.</p>

<p>By and by something white moving
about near an old stump caught<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
his attention. At once he hurried
over to satisfy his curiosity. When
he got near enough he discovered a
little fellow dressed in black-and-white.
He had a big plumy tail
and he was very busy minding his
own business. He hardly glanced
at Boxer.</p>

<p>Boxer stared at him for a few
minutes. &#8220;Hello,&#8221; he ventured
finally.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good morning. It is a fine
morning, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said the little
stranger politely.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221; demanded
the little Bear rudely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just minding my own business,&#8221;
replied the little stranger pleasantly.
&#8220;Where is your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know and I don&#8217;t care.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
I&#8217;ve left home,&#8221; said Boxer, trying
to look big and important.</p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t say!&#8221; exclaimed the
little stranger. &#8220;Aren&#8217;t you
rather small to be starting out alone
in the Great World?&#8221;</p>

<p>Now Boxer was so much bigger
than this little stranger in black-and-white,
and the little stranger
was so very polite, that already
Boxer felt that the little stranger
must be afraid of him. All Boxer&#8217;s
previous feeling of bigness and importance
came back to him. He
wanted to show off. He wanted
this little stranger to respect him.
To have that stranger suggest that
he was rather small to be out alone
in the Great World hurt Boxer&#8217;s
pride. In fact, it made him angry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>&#8220;If I were as small as you, perhaps
I would feel that way,&#8221;
retorted Boxer rudely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t use the right word.
I should have said young instead
of small,&#8221; explained the stranger
mildly. &#8220;Of course, I am small
compared with you, but I am fully
gown and have been out in the
Great World a long time, while you
are very young and just starting
out. I wonder if your mother
knows where you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is none of your business
whether my mother knows or not,&#8221;
retorted Boxer more rudely than
before, for he was growing more
and more angry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly not. I haven&#8217;t said
it was,&#8221; replied the stranger, still<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
speaking politely. &#8220;I am not in
the least interested. Besides, I
know anyway. I know that she
doesn&#8217;t know. I know that you
have run away, and I know that
you have some bitter lessons to
learn before you will be fitted to
live by yourself in the Great World.
If you will just step aside, I will
be much obliged. There is a big
piece of bark just back of you
under which there may be some fat
beetles.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sammy Jay</span> had followed Boxer,
for he felt sure that things were
bound to happen wherever that
little Bear was. So Sammy saw
his meeting with Jimmy Skunk.
He saw how polite Jimmy was
and how very impolite the little
Bear was.</p>

<p>Sammy understood perfectly.
He knew that probably Boxer
knew nothing at all about Jimmy
Skunk and never had heard of
that little bag of scent carried by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Jimmy and dreaded by all of
Jimmy&#8217;s neighbors. He knew that
the little Bear was rude, simply
because he was so much bigger
than Jimmy Skunk that he could
see no reason for being polite,
especially as Jimmy had asked him
to do something he didn&#8217;t want
to do.</p>

<p>When Jimmy Skunk began to
lose patience, Sammy Jay thought
it was time for him to give Boxer
a little advice. &#8220;Don&#8217;t be silly!
Do as Jimmy Skunk tells you to,
or you will be the sorriest little
Bear that ever lived!&#8221; screamed
Sammy, as he saw Jimmy&#8217;s great
plume of a tail begin to go up,
which is Jimmy&#8217;s signal of danger.</p>

<p>But Boxer, foolish little Bear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
that he was, couldn&#8217;t see anything
to fear from one so much smaller
than he. So he paid no attention
to Jimmy&#8217;s request that he step
aside. Instead he laughed in the
most impudent way.</p>

<p>&#8220;Run! Run!&#8221; screamed Sammy
Jay.</p>

<p>Boxer didn&#8217;t move. Jimmy
Skunk stamped angrily with his
front feet. Then something happened.
Yes, sir, something happened.
It was so sudden and so
unexpected that Boxer didn&#8217;t know
exactly what had happened, but he
was very much aware that it <i>had</i>
happened. Something was in his
eyes and made them smart and for
a few minutes blinded him. Something
was choking him; it seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
to him he could hardly breathe.
And there was the most awful
odor he ever had smelled.</p>

<p>Boxer rolled over and over and
over on the ground. He was trying
to get away from that
awful odor. But he couldn&#8217;t. He
couldn&#8217;t, for the very good reason
that he carried it along with him.
You see, Jimmy Skunk had punished
that silly little Bear by throwing
on him a little of that powerful
scent he always carries with him
to use in time of danger or when
provoked.</p>

<p>&#8220;What did I tell you? What
did I tell you?&#8221; screamed Sammy
Jay. &#8220;I guess you won&#8217;t interfere
with Jimmy Skunk again in a
hurry. It serves you right. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
serves you just right. But it is
hard on the people who live about
here. Yes, sir, it is hard on them
to have all the sweetness of the
Green Forest spoiled by that scent
of Jimmy Skunk&#8217;s. I can&#8217;t stand
it myself, so I&#8217;ll be moving along.
It serves you right, you silly little
Bear. It serves you right.&#8221; With
this Sammy Jay flew away.</p>

<p>Boxer knew then that Jimmy
Skunk had been the cause of this
new and dreadful trouble he was
in, and great respect mingled with
fear took possession of him. And
oh, how Boxer wished that he
hadn&#8217;t been impolite! How he
wished he hadn&#8217;t refused to do as
Jimmy Skunk had politely asked
him to!</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>&#8220;I wish I hadn&#8217;t! I wish
I hadn&#8217;t! I wish I hadn&#8217;t!&#8221;
sobbed Boxer over and over,
as he tried to get away from that
dreadful smell and couldn&#8217;t.</p>

more and getting into more and
more trouble, Mother Bear had
been worrying about him, and she
and his twin sister, Woof-Woof,
had been everywhere but the
right place looking for him.</p>

<p>You remember that Mother
Bear and Woof-Woof had been
away from home when Boxer
decided to run away. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
they returned, Boxer had been
gone so long that Mother Bear&#8217;s
nose failed to find enough of his
scent to follow. So when she
started to look for him, she
started in the wrong direction.
Of course, she had to take Woof-Woof
with her, and because
Woof-Woof got tired after a while,
Mother Bear couldn&#8217;t hunt as
thoroughly as she would have
done had she been alone.</p>

<p>At first Woof-Woof felt very
badly indeed at the loss of her
little twin brother. Down in her
heart she admired him for his
boldness in running away, but
when she thought of all the
dreadful things that might happen
to him out in the Great World,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
she became very sorrowful. This
was at first. After she had
tramped and tramped and tramped
behind Mother Bear, tramped
until her feet ached, she became
cross. She blamed Boxer, and
quite rightly, for those aching feet.
The more they ached the crosser
she became, until she tried to
make herself believe that she
didn&#8217;t care what happened to
that heedless brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care if I never see
him again,&#8221; she grumbled. &#8220;I
don&#8217;t care what happens to him.
Whatever happens will serve him
right. I wish Mother Bear would
remember that my legs are not
as long as hers. I&#8217;m tired. I
want to rest. I want to rest, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
do. I want to rest. Ouch! My
feet are getting sore.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now such news as Jimmy
Skunk&#8217;s punishment of Boxer
travels fast through the Green
Forest, and it wasn&#8217;t long before
the story of it reached Mrs.
Bear&#8217;s ears. She growled dreadful
threats of what she would do
if she met Jimmy Skunk, though
she knew very well that she
would politely step aside if she
did meet him, and then she
started for the place where Boxer
had been given his lessons in
politeness by Jimmy Skunk.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about the
place when they reached it.
&#8220;Phew!&#8221; cried Woof-Woof, holding
her nose.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>Mother Bear merely grunted
and started off faster than before.
Woof-Woof had to run to keep
up with her. Mother Bear had
that smell to guide her now.
She knew that all she had to do
now to find her runaway son was
to follow up that smell.</p>

<p>So it was that just as the
Black Shadows were beginning to
creep through the Green Forest,
and poor little Boxer, a very
lonely, miserable and frightened
little Bear, was beginning to
dread another night, he heard a
crashing in the brush, and out
came Mother Bear and Woof-Woof.
With a glad squeal of
joy, Boxer started to run toward
them. But a growl, such an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
ugly growl, from Mother Bear
stopped him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you come near us,&#8221;
said she. &#8220;You can follow us,
but don&#8217;t you dare come a step
nearer than you are now. It
would serve you right if we had
nothing more to do with you, but
after all, you are rather small
to be wandering about alone.
Besides, there is no knowing
what more disgrace you would
get us into. Now come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Boxer looked at Woof-Woof for
some sign of sympathy. But
Woof-Woof held her head very
high and turned up her nose at
him. &#8220;Phew!&#8221; said she.</p>

<div class="verseright"><i>Mother Bear.</i></div>
</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Bear</span> is one of those mothers
who believe in punishment.
She believes that the cub who is
never punished for wrong-doing is
almost sure to grow up to be of
little or no use in the Great World,
provided he lives to grow up at all.
She doubts if he will live to grow
up at all. So her cubs are
promptly punished when they disobey
or do wrong, and they are
punished in a way to make them
remember.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>Now when Boxer, the lost little
cub who had had such a dreadful
time, saw Mother Bear and his sister
Woof-Woof, he thought all his
troubles were at an end. Perhaps
you can guess what his feelings
were when he was stopped short
by a growl from Mother Bear.
He wanted&mdash;oh, how he wanted&mdash;to
rush up to her and snuggle
against her and feel her big paws
gently patting him.</p>

<p>But there was to be none of that.
It was plain that Mother Bear
meant exactly what she said when
she told him to come no nearer.
And when he looked to his twin
sister, Woof-Woof, she turned up
her nose and it was quite clear that
she wanted nothing to do with him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>Poor little Boxer. He didn&#8217;t
understand it at all at first. You
see, in the joy of being found, he
had forgotten that he still carried
that dreadful scent with which
Jimmy Skunk had punished him,
and so no one, not even his mother
or sister, would want him very near.
When Woof-Woof cried &#8220;Phew!&#8221;
as she turned up her nose he remembered.
He hung his head and
meekly shuffled along after his
mother and sister, taking care to
get no nearer to them. He didn&#8217;t
dare to, for every few steps Mother
Bear would swing her head around
and grumble a warning.</p>

<p>And this was just the beginning
of Boxer&#8217;s punishment. Day after
day he tagged along, far behind,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
but always keeping his mother and
sister in sight. You may be sure
he took care to do that. He had
had quite enough of seeing the
Great World alone. Not for anything
would he be lost again. But
it was hard, very hard, to have
only what was left when Mother
Bear found a feast. What he
didn&#8217;t know was that Mother Bear
always took care that there should
be a fair share left. At such times
Woof-Woof took great joy in
smacking her lips while Boxer sat
up watching from a distance.</p>

<p>When they slept Boxer had to
curl up by himself. At first this
was the hardest of all. But little
by little he got used to it. He
didn&#8217;t know and Woof-Woof didn&#8217;t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
know, but Mother Bear did, that
this was good for him; it was making
him more and more sure of
himself. And tagging along behind
as he did every day was doing
the same thing. He was always
looking for something that Mother
Bear and Woof-Woof might have
missed. And so he learned to use
his eyes and his nose and his ears
better than Woof-Woof did, for she
depended more on Mother Bear, being
right at her heels.</p>

<p>As the days passed, Boxer&#8217;s coat
became more and more free from
that dreadful scent. Boxer had
become so used to it that he didn&#8217;t
notice it at all, so he wasn&#8217;t conscious
when it began to grow less.
At last it got so that it was hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
to be noticed excepting on rainy or
very damp days. For a long time
after Mother Bear had permitted
him to resume his place with Woof-Woof,
she drove him away on such
days.</p>

<p>So at last Boxer&#8217;s punishment
ended. Mother Bear gave him a
good talking to and said that she
hoped this would be a lesson he
never would forget. &#8220;Yes&#8217;m, it
will,&#8221; he had replied very meekly,
and he knew it would. Then he
took his place once more, save
that now, instead of following at
Mother Bear&#8217;s heels, he allowed
Woof-Woof to do that and he
followed her. Though Woof-Woof
didn&#8217;t suspect it, he preferred
it so.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>So Buster Bear&#8217;s twins grew and
grew until every one said that
they were the finest young Bears
ever seen in the Green Forest.</p>

<p>Billy Mink says that these cubs
have received attention enough
and that there are other people who
should be considered. Perhaps
Billy is right, though I suspect he
is thinking of himself. Anyway
this ends the Green Forest series
and the next book will be the first
in the Smiling Pool series. The
title will be Billy Mink.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
